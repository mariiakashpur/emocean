  <resource id="1.2">So thank you, friends and family.</resource>
  <resource id="1.3">It was crazy, it was drunken, it was new and it was damn fun and I realized that there is less to learn from happy things but there are important messages you gain from good experiences.</resource>
  <resource id="1.4">A lot of that teaches you about the light at the end of the tunnel.</resource>
  <resource id="1.5">I've found it but I've also found other tunnels.</resource>
  <resource id="1.6">I'll try not to get sappy but thank you Mr. John.</resource>

  <resource id="4.50">Having to hide it every single day, it's such a struggle, there's so many secrets so many lies, its all so confusing and you start to loose yourself.</resource>
  <resource id="4.51">Yet there's that group of people, that secret society, the people who know, know how it feels why it hurts.</resource>
  <resource id="4.52">The people that just have to send a "hug" and it puts a smile on your face.</resource>
  <resource id="4.53">Or those who tell you what to do, tell you it's going to be okay, give advice, promise they'll always be there and you know they will be.</resource>

  <resource id="4.55">Yet you know things about them that not even their parents know, and it doesn't matter.</resource>
  <resource id="4.56">They don't judge you, you're not stereotyped.</resource>

  <resource id="5.67">*flails* At least it's not the unable to say anything gig that I had with Erik.</resource>
  <resource id="5.68">I want to get to know him and know more about him.</resource>
  <resource id="5.69">It's very exciting prospect, but I'm afraid I'm only going to screw it up or something.</resource>
  <resource id="5.70">I hope we have more clases together in the future.</resource>
  <resource id="5.71">We had one last semester and now we have one this semester.</resource>
  <resource id="5.72">I finally noticed his eye color and it's average, but still exciting.</resource>
  <resource id="5.73">This is so pathetic.</resource>
  <resource id="5.74">It really is. Though I'm not 100% optomitistic about it, I'm just glad that for once, a guy might like it me and be interested, and not end up being a Melvin &lt;3 </resource>

  <resource id="7.83">Visiting Bard was like a warm blanket.</resource>
  <resource id="7.84">One of the new freshmen there said to me, "oh, so you're Liz!" like i was a character from lore.</resource>
  <resource id="7.85">I was also not likeing my life at home then, so I was much happier during my visits.</resource>

  <resource id="15.209">Shw weighed 7 lbs 5 oz and is 20.5 inches long.</resource>
  <resource id="15.210">I can't believe she is FINALLY here!!!</resource>
  <resource id="15.211">I was seriously starting to give up and think that I was going to be pregnant forever!!!</resource>
  <resource id="15.212">After the doctor on Tuesday, I cleaned house, played basketball and soccer with Levi, then went to Amanda's to sit and talk with her while she moved in.</resource>
  <resource id="15.213">I didn't get in bed till like 2:30 in the morning and woke up at 6:30 having the most awful contraction EVER!</resource>
  <resource id="15.214">I waited till it was over then went to the bathroom and before I got done, I was having another contraction!</resource>
  <resource id="15.215">They were like 4-5 minutes apart.</resource>
  <resource id="15.216">So, I woke up mom and we went to the hospital and about 5 hours later, Grace Danielle graced us with her pressence!!!</resource>
  <resource id="15.217">:) It wasn't all that graceful though, to tell you the truth.</resource>
  <resource id="15.218">I had a lot harder of a time with her than with Levi, but it's all worthwhile.</resource>
  <resource id="15.219">She is so precious.</resource>
  <resource id="15.220">Except she dosen't look a THING like me. Everyone seems to think she has alot of Daniel in her.</resource>
  <resource id="15.221">including me. She has sooo much hair, it is crazy- but then again so did Levi.</resource>
  <resource id="15.222">She's such a good baby, only cries when she needs to be changed or fed. She's already spoiled though, I have the hardest time putting her down.</resource>
  <resource id="15.223">:) Levi is really exciting to be a big brother, he thinks she is sooooo cool.</resource>
  <resource id="15.224">:) He seems SO big now!</resource>
  <resource id="15.225">But anyways.</resource>
  <resource id="15.226">I'll be putting more pictures up probably sometime this week so keep your eye out for the AMAZING GRACE!!!</resource>

  <resource id="19.277">It was seriously weird with it kind of.</resource>
  <resource id="19.278">being fixed up.</resource>
  <resource id="19.279">So in the dream there were times where we were both kinda unsure, but it was still happy (for the both of us I hope).</resource>
  <resource id="19.280">XD The whole being treated as a princess thing was weird.</resource>
  <resource id="19.281">there was some older lady who was doing my hair and was annoyed with me because I wouldn't stand up straight (she told O'Connell to make me behave or something WTF), but it was kinda cool and fancy-like.</resource>
  <resource id="19.282">That's odd though, as I don't usually care for dressy occassions.</resource>
  <resource id="19.283">BUT HEY.</resource>

  <resource id="19.285">I totally didn't want to wake up, I can say that.</resource>

  <resource id="28.400">I can honestly say my views of the world I live in changed while in high school.</resource>
  <resource id="28.401">Even though I had began participating more in the Catholic church while in junior high, it wasn't until I were about 15 when I began to take a more active role in the church.</resource>
  <resource id="28.402">I remember being so impressed, with the youth programs of the other parishes in my area, and the stong bond that everyone had withen their own groups, regardless of the social status of each person.</resource>
  <resource id="28.403">When they were together everyone was equal.</resource>
  <resource id="28.404">Which was such a contrast when compared to the small group I belonged to.</resource>
  <resource id="28.405">So, I guess it was my disapointment in my own group that lead me to pursue a more active role in the diocese.</resource>
  <resource id="28.406">I began pushing for the group to start doing more for themselves and for everyone else that was around them.</resource>
  <resource id="28.407">We began to help serve lunches at the local Loaves &amp; Fishes,  volunteer work for the school at our parish, offer lodging for other traveling youth groups.</resource>
  <resource id="28.408">There were also other various events that I ended up doing on my own, due to the lack of interest from others in my group.</resource>
  <resource id="28.409">It wasn't easy to talk people into getting up at 5am and work outside unloading trucks of food into a freezing trailor, so that everything that just came in can be placed into bags and given to familes that were having a hard time making ends meet.</resource>
  <resource id="28.410">I remember doing endless fundraisers for almost everything we did.</resource>
  <resource id="28.411">There were national events for Catholic youth that were able to attend, religious retreats, missionary work, and myself and a very few others were selected to goto a Christian leadership program that was offered at the time.</resource>
  <resource id="28.412">Oops, I guess I should get to how all of this fits into "misunderstandings" that people ended up having.</resource>
  <resource id="28.413">See, the whole time that I was trying to develop my own faith, attending events with other parishes, and all the work I did with my own group.</resource>
  <resource id="28.414">I actually thought I was making a difference.</resource>
  <resource id="28.415">And sadly.</resource>
  <resource id="28.416">that's where my misunderstanding comes in.</resource>
  <resource id="28.417">Everyone has been given a gift in life.</resource>
  <resource id="28.418">Some people are quite talented in the arts, some have awesome talent in athletics, and some have been gifted with beauty.</resource>
  <resource id="28.419">My gift from the man upstairs is the ablility to help others with the their problems.</resource>
  <resource id="28.420">Simply by just listening to them speak, and more often just being in someones presence has been known to have the answer someone is looking for to just dawn on them.</resource>
  <resource id="28.421">So with this gift and a new and improved self-esteem from the one I had in junior high, also the sense of humor I have I devolped around that time too.</resource>
  <resource id="28.422">I became quite popular with everyone.</resource>
  <resource id="28.423">High School is full of drama, broken hearts, and trouble of all kinds.</resource>
  <resource id="28.424">How can being popular be a problem?</resource>
  <resource id="28.425">When the only time people would talk to you is about thier problems.</resource>
  <resource id="28.426">They would act sad and depressed around me because of their troubles, and then act their happy normal selves around everyone else.</resource>
  <resource id="28.427">Man, that sucked.</resource>
  <resource id="28.428">for I found that my gift came with certain flaws.</resource>
  <resource id="28.429">As in for all the people that brought their problems to me, no one would be there for me when it came to my own.</resource>
  <resource id="28.430">It was too much weight for me to carry, my own plus everyone elses.</resource>
  <resource id="28.431">and then it happened.</resource>

<block id="block 32">
  <resource id="32.519">Here I am again!</resource>
  <resource id="32.520">Broadcasting this time from the New World.</resource>
  <resource id="32.521">It's been a solid half year since I sent word out, and I will now attempt to encapsulate the last six months into one last epic email.</resource>
  <resource id="32.522">Exciting, no?</resource>
  <resource id="32.523">So, to the task!</resource>
  <resource id="32.524">Well.</resource>
  <resource id="32.525">where did we leave off?</resource>
  <resource id="32.526">I believe it was April, and spring had just arrived.</resource>
  <resource id="32.527">I'll start my narrative with a little anecdote about how small the world really is. So I was going to work one day, headed to one of the hostels around Berlin to pick people up for the tour, and then bring them back to the Brandenburg Gate where the tour starts.</resource>
  <resource id="32.528">I had never been to this particular hostel before, and as I entered and gave my little spiel about the tour and asked if anyone wanted to come along, I was met not with a roar of enthusiasm from the hostel residents, but rather a few dull, glass-eyed looks and was generally ignored.</resource>
  <resource id="32.529">As I was preparing to leave, one guy over at the computers yelled out for me to wait, approached me and said hello.</resource>
  <resource id="32.530">At this point I recognize him as Patrick, a friend of mine from college that I haven't seen in at least three years.</resource>
  <resource id="32.531">He had arrived twenty minutes beforehand at the hostel, hadn't even checked in yet, and just happened to be in the lobby when I was.</resource>
  <resource id="32.532">So he just took his backpack with him and came on my tour.</resource>
  <resource id="32.533">We had a great time catching up, and went out that night together as well.</resource>
  <resource id="32.534">But it's certainly strange how you randomly run in to people you haven't seen in years, in little hole-in-the-walls in Europe.</resource>
  <resource id="32.535">Fun times.</resource>
  <resource id="32.536">The rest of April passed rather uneventfully, and in May I went to see a production of Faust Part I at the Deutsches Theater.</resource>
  <resource id="32.537">It was my first time in this particular theater, hailed as the best theater in Germany.</resource>
  <resource id="32.538">And this particular piece was by far the best play I have EVER seen.</resource>
  <resource id="32.539">It was breathtaking.</resource>
  <resource id="32.540">The acting was more than phenomenal, it was virtuosic.</resource>
  <resource id="32.541">It was also incredibly simple, cutting the normally huge cast down to only seven performers.</resource>
  <resource id="32.542">I walked out of the theater that night completely dumbstruck and inspired.</resource>
  <resource id="32.543">I still can't think of the show without getting goose bumps.</resource>
  <resource id="32.544">It's moments like that that remind me why I've chosen theatre as a profession.</resource>
  <resource id="32.545">My next big adventure was a trip I took to London at the end of May. I had never been before, and had been planning on this trip for about six months.</resource>
  <resource id="32.546">I was lucky enough to be able to stay with some friends to cut down on the cost, and see a different side of London life.</resource>
  <resource id="32.547">It was sooooo much fun!</resource>
  <resource id="32.548">I saw most of the major sites on my own, and I went to the theater almost every night I was there.</resource>
  <resource id="32.549">This aspect of the trip was hit and miss. The first piece I saw was a new one by Peter Schaefer called 'Market Boy', directed by Trevor Nunn at the National Theater.</resource>
  <resource id="32.550">I thought: "wow, with that much talent behind it, it's gotta be good!"</resource>
  <resource id="32.551">Wrong.</resource>
  <resource id="32.552">WRONG.</resource>
  <resource id="32.553">Oh how wrong I was.</resource>
  <resource id="32.554">The show was trash.</resource>
  <resource id="32.555">Horrible.</resource>
  <resource id="32.556">Horribly acted, horribly directed, weak script.</resource>
  <resource id="32.557">And interminably long!</resource>
  <resource id="32.558">Three hours of horror.</resource>
  <resource id="32.559">I wanted to leave at intermission, but my date was really enjoying it (should have been a sign) so we stayed.</resource>
  <resource id="32.560">I guess the one good thing I took from it was that I know now that the British are just as capable as we are of producing really awful work.</resource>
  <resource id="32.561">It was nice to understand that, just wish I didn't have to experience it first hand.</resource>
  <resource id="32.562">While in London I also saw Coriolanus at the Globe Theater.</resource>
  <resource id="32.563">Now this was amazing.</resource>
  <resource id="32.564">Shakespeare, old school.</resource>
  <resource id="32.565">The performers were incredible, and one of the generals was played by Geoffrey, the butler from Fresh Prince of Bellaire.</resource>
  <resource id="32.566">That in itself was hilarious, and made us love the show even more.</resource>
  <resource id="32.567">I also saw Les Miserables for the first time, and it was fun.</resource>
  <resource id="32.568">Loved London.</resource>
  <resource id="32.569">The city was great, the energy was incredible.</resource>
  <resource id="32.570">Loved the free museums.</resource>
  <resource id="32.571">Especially the British Museum.</resource>
  <resource id="32.572">Great East London accents.</resource>
  <resource id="32.573">Soooo many monuments, including two statues in front of Buckingham Palace that had a conspicuous Communist message.</resource>
  <resource id="32.574">It was a worker with a hammer and a peasant woman with a sickle situated behind Queen Victoria's back , and glowering at the palace.</resource>
  <resource id="32.575">Now maybe I was just reading too much into this, or maybe I had spent too much time in the eastern bloc talking about Communist symbolism.</resource>
  <resource id="32.576">But I don't' think so.</resource>
  <resource id="32.577">And the funniest part, the two statues said they were donated by New Zealand.</resource>
  <resource id="32.578">Curious.</resource>
  <resource id="32.579">next time you're in Wellington, watch out for the Kiwi Commies!</resource>
  <resource id="32.580">After London came the World Cup.</resource>
  <resource id="32.581">Now I have a confession to make: before the World Cup began I had actually never seen an entire soccer game from start to finish.</resource>
  <resource id="32.582">That changed very quickly.</resource>
  <resource id="32.583">First of all, the atmosphere in the city was insane.</resource>
  <resource id="32.584">There were SO many people from all over the world.</resource>
  <resource id="32.585">They would prowl the city in packs of 6-10, all wearing their national colors, often their flags as capes, drinking absurd amounts of beer and singing their soccer songs.</resource>
  <resource id="32.586">The hordes of people would change from day to day, for instance there was a three day period where we had over 90,000 Swedes in the city, leading up to their dramatic defeat at the hands of Zeh Germans.</resource>
  <resource id="32.587">Then there were the Brazilians, everywhere, singing-clapping-dancing-taking pictures, and of course the pale and pasty Brits with their cock-eyed stares and drinking songs.</resource>
  <resource id="32.588">Loads of fun.</resource>
  <resource id="32.589">I didn't have tickets to any of the games, but my group of friends would always go to a cafe or bar of the nationality that was playing to watch the match.</resource>
  <resource id="32.590">So to a French cafe for the France-Swiss game, a Tapas bar when Spain played, drank Caiprinhas with the passionate Brazilians, etc. It was a colorful and hilarious way to take part without fighting the crowds.</resource>
  <resource id="32.591">And let me tell you how good the World Cup was for Berlin as a city, and Germany as a nation.</resource>
  <resource id="32.592">First of all, Berlin is a hugely under populated city.</resource>
  <resource id="32.593">So it was really nice to have an extra two million people in the city to sort of liven things up.</resource>
  <resource id="32.594">The energy was incredible.</resource>
  <resource id="32.595">Another interesting element was the latent patriotism that emerged during the Cup.</resource>
  <resource id="32.596">Now this merits explaining: before the World Cup began, if you waved a German flag in the streets, you would probably be called a Nazi and at the very least labeled as a radical right wing nutter.</resource>
  <resource id="32.597">You have to understand that the Germans have had a really difficult time with their national identity (and subsequently national pride or patriotism of any kind) since the Second World War.</resource>
  <resource id="32.598">Because of the way Hitler appealed to, and exploited, German nationalism in the 30's and 40's, as a means of supporting his plans of conquest, the Germans are now hyper-sensitive about any kind of patriotic resurgence, and its consequences.</resource>
  <resource id="32.599">Which also explains why they are so openly critical of America's post-9/11 patriotic-fever, in connection with the Bush administrations aggressive foreign policy.</resource>
  <resource id="32.600">And for what it's worth I agree with them, it makes me nervous too.</resource>
  <resource id="32.601">So.</resource>
  <resource id="32.602">taking all of this into account, you can imagine the entire country's surprise when after the Germany-Costa Rica match, in which the Germans soundly defeated them, Germany became one giant street party, shutting down all central streets in the capital with a flood of humanity cheering, yelling, hugging, DRINKING, and curiously.</resource>
  <resource id="32.603">waving German flags everywhere.</resource>
  <resource id="32.604">In the streets, hanging from windows, decorating cars, and painted on faces.</resource>
  <resource id="32.605">People were genuinely excited about supporting their national team, and taking pride in its accomplishments.</resource>
  <resource id="32.606">Now this newfound enthusiasm certainly was not shared by everyone.</resource>
  <resource id="32.607">In fact the entire month of June was one continuous debate in the media between prominent politicians, celebrities, writers (such as Guenther Grass and Christa Wolf), and other intellectuals about the meaning, origin and impact of this nationalism.</resource>
  <resource id="32.608">And of course no one can laboriously dissect an idea better than the Germans.</resource>
  <resource id="32.609">But the general consensus after five weeks of debate was that the newfound national pride was a positive thing.</resource>
  <resource id="32.610">And at that point it was pretty much irrelevant anyway, because after every one of Germany's wins the party was getting bigger and the flag waving more intense.</resource>
  <resource id="32.611">Personally I thought it was wonderful.</resource>
  <resource id="32.612">It was amazing to see my German friends cheering their heads off, enraptured in the glory of a winning team, a team that represents the best of your nation while the whole world watches.</resource>
  <resource id="32.613">It was an important moment for Germany, and in Berlin the atmosphere was pure magic.</resource>
  <resource id="32.614">A side note: the World Cup also went off completely safely.</resource>
  <resource id="32.615">The Berlin police especially handled the situation expertly, and were always present without being obtrusive.</resource>
  <resource id="32.616">In fact they did such a good job, that they are now training the Swiss police for the upcoming European Championship in two years.</resource>
  <resource id="32.617">In June I had also been training at work to lead tours of Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp, which I started at the end of the month.</resource>
  <resource id="32.618">This camp, about 40 miles north of Berlin was the second major camp to be opened in the Nazi system, and was also used by the Russians after the war to intern former Nazi's and anyone else deemed an 'enemy of the state'.</resource>
  <resource id="32.619">Given the dark history of such a place you can well imagine the difficulty of retelling that information, and trying to put it into some kind of historical context.</resource>
  <resource id="32.620">I ended up doing tours out there for the duration of the summer.</resource>
  <resource id="32.621">I found the job challenging, and extremely rewarding.</resource>
  <resource id="32.622">After a July of beautiful weather and great summer adventures, I traveled with my good Australian friend Kurt to a theater festival in Cyprus.</resource>
  <resource id="32.623">The occasion was that a good friend of mine from North Texas, Jessica, was playing the title role in Medea at a theater festival there.</resource>
  <resource id="32.624">I was planning on going to Greece sometime anyway, so we spent three days in Athens, and two and a half in Cyprus.</resource>
  <resource id="32.625">Now this was ridiculous amounts of fun!</resource>
  <resource id="32.626">If Athens had a particular style, it would probably be called: "Landfill-chic".</resource>
  <resource id="32.627">The city is a sweaty, dirty, polluted hole.</resource>
  <resource id="32.628">Take your impression of a squalor-filled Mediterranean capital, and add this to your image: 10 story apartment buildings everywhere, in 100 degree heat, all cooled by wall-mounted air conditioners, a.k.a. swamp boxes.</resource>
  <resource id="32.629">Now take into account that said air conditioners are mounted on the windows, sticking out over the street.</resource>
  <resource id="32.630">Now imagine the condensation from thousands of swamp box coolers pitter pattering on your head as you stroll down the trashy Athens streets.</resource>
  <resource id="32.631">Now add a couple of poorly placed ancient columns.</resource>
  <resource id="32.632">WELCOME TO ATHENS!!</resource>
  <resource id="32.633">Okay, it wasn't really as bad as all that.</resource>
  <resource id="32.634">But it was close.</resource>
  <resource id="32.635">And the city itself really is lovely, in it's own way.</resource>
  <resource id="32.636">But two days back to back was more than enough.</resource>
  <resource id="32.637">We took a day trip out to Sunion, the very tip of Greece, to see the temple of Poseidon.</resource>
  <resource id="32.638">Now this was really amazing.</resource>
  <resource id="32.639">It took us about two hours to get out there, and then we climbed around and played on the rocks for about an hour, taking pics of the magnificent old temple ruin that is literally clinging to the cliff face.</resource>
  <resource id="32.640">And then we watched in amazement with fifty other tourists as the sun went down in front of the temple, over the Mediterranean.</resource>
  <resource id="32.641">Talk about a Bellevue!</resource>
  <resource id="32.642">The sky is so amazing in Greece, it feels like you could really reach up and touch it, it's so close!</resource>
  <resource id="32.643">And of course this just enhanced the magic of the sunset, as the red orb of  the sun ever so slowly retreated behind the furthest hill.</resource>
  <resource id="32.644">So slow in fact we could actually count down it's descent and give it a big round of applause when it winked out of sight.</resource>
  <resource id="32.645">What an experience.</resource>
  <resource id="32.646">So after a few days in Athens, it was off to Cyrprus with Aegean Airlines, which has the best looking flight attendants OF ALL TIME.</resource>
  <resource id="32.647">Just FYI.</resource>
  <resource id="32.648">They also bake bread for you on the plane so that your in flight meal is fresh.</resource>
  <resource id="32.649">Not bad.</resource>
  <resource id="32.650">Cyprus was amazing.</resource>
  <resource id="32.651">We saw Jessica's production of Medea, and were treated incredibly well by her colleagues at the festival.</resource>
  <resource id="32.652">We stayed in a tiny mountain village called Droushia, and these people brought hospitality to incredible new heights.</resource>
  <resource id="32.653">They did everything they could to make us feel welcome, everything from putting us up in a beautiful hotel, refusing to let us pay for anything, and making sure that our stay on their island was as enchanting as the stories always make it out to be.</resource>
  <resource id="32.654">Our first day we went swimming on the south side of the island, in the most brilliant blue water I have ever seen.</resource>
  <resource id="32.655">We spent pretty much the whole day (outside of a decadent lunch at the beach house) in the water.</resource>
  <resource id="32.656">When we bubbled to our hosts that evening about their splendid beaches, they scoffed saying: "The south side, that's not even the good part.</resource>
  <resource id="32.657">Tomorrow we'll go somewhere special."</resource>
  <resource id="32.658">And they weren't kidding.</resource>
  <resource id="32.659">The next morning, the last day of the festival, they piled us all into four wheel drive vehicles, and took us off the map to an area that I will henceforth be labeling The Blue Lagoon.</resource>
  <resource id="32.660">Imagine the most incredible, horseshoe shaped cove, with unimaginably blue water, and a giant stone underneath the water, hundreds of meters long and wide, adding depth to the color.</resource>
  <resource id="32.661">What's more, we had the whole place to ourselves.</resource>
  <resource id="32.662">Our hosts had brought along a lunch of fresh fruit and we broke our fast on a cliff overlooking the whole gorgeous expanse.</resource>
  <resource id="32.663">The Cypriot people are some of the most genuine, hospitable, and quirky people I have ever encountered.</resource>
  <resource id="32.664">It was really interesting staying with them in this little mountain village, and getting to experience a bit of what their culture was all about.</resource>
  <resource id="32.665">Oh and the food is incredible.</resource>
  <resource id="32.666">They make their own very strong coffee, and Haloumi cheese, which we were told (a hundred different times by all the little old ladies) was goat cheese.</resource>
  <resource id="32.667">But not feta.</resource>
  <resource id="32.668">Haloumi.</resource>
  <resource id="32.669">Haloumi has nothing to do with Feta.</resource>
  <resource id="32.670">Don't ever mistake Haloumi for Feta, or you might have a flock of barely intelligible Cypriot grammas spend half an hour pinching your cheek and explaining the difference in broken Greco-English.</resource>
  <resource id="32.671">They take their cheese seriously.</resource>
  <resource id="32.672">So after a few whirlwind days on the island, we flew back to Athens, spent a day seeing the Akropolis, Parthenon, Theater of Dionysos, etc. They all lived up to my expectations, and far exceeded them.</resource>
  <resource id="32.673">Its really a testament to the vision of the ancients that in our world of skyscrapers and technical gadgetry, we are still fascinated by a two thousand year-old arrangement of stones.</resource>
  <resource id="32.674">After returning from Greece my last few weeks in Berlin passed very quickly.</resource>
  <resource id="32.675">I was leading loads of tours, and working on a short film I was directing.</resource>
  <resource id="32.676">The time flew by and before I knew it, August was at an end and my doorstep was graced by my best friend Lance, who had come to Berlin for my last week.</resource>
  <resource id="32.677">So I spent the next six days in a haze of working my final tours, partying, and showing Lance the city that I had come to love so much over the last two years.</resource>
  <resource id="32.678">After a fabulous and emotional going-away party, we left Berlin in the last days of August, and took an ICE express train (sooooo fast) to Zurich.</resource>
  <resource id="32.679">Lance and I spent the better part of the next three days lounging around Zurich and drinking in Switzerland.</resource>
  <resource id="32.680">We were both pretty destroyed from lack of sleep/too much fun over the last week in Berlin, so most of what we did in Zurich consisted of going to the grocery, eating a picnic brunch on the river or the lake, taking a nap after said lunch, and then wandering around the quaint little downtown area and lamenting the fact that we couldn't afford anything.</resource>
  <resource id="32.681">People say London or Paris is expensive; no.</resource>
  <resource id="32.682">Zurich is expensive.</resource>
  <resource id="32.683">But we didn't let that discourage us.</resource>
  <resource id="32.684">We had a ball in Zurich.</resource>
  <resource id="32.685">We went on a walking tour, went to the City Museum (located in an old castle, very cool), and had a good time relaxing and enjoying the AMAZING views.</resource>
  <resource id="32.686">The city is incredibly beautiful, tucked into the Alps and right on the water.</resource>
  <resource id="32.687">Pretty as a picture.</resource>
  <resource id="32.688">After our detox detour en Suisse, we headed via night train to Paris.</resource>
  <resource id="32.689">I think the most important thing I can say about this city, is that all of the rumors: That the city's dirty, the people are rude, the language barrier is insurmountable, the metro is incomprehensible, you things will be stolen, that they hate Americans.</resource>
  <resource id="32.690">are UNTRUE!!</resource>
  <resource id="32.691">There is no city in Europe that I had more trepidation about visiting (because of all the horror stories I had heard) and no city in Europe that it was easier for me to be enchanted by and fall in love with.</resource>
  <resource id="32.692">It's called the city of love and light for a reason.</resource>
  <resource id="32.693">It's so amazingly beautiful, just like all the pictures.</resource>
  <resource id="32.694">The museums are life-changing.</resource>
  <resource id="32.695">The Eiffel Tower is breathtaking, and seeing it in person destroys its cliche and makes you fall in love with the thing.</resource>
  <resource id="32.696">The people are absolutely LOVELY.</resource>
  <resource id="32.697">We encountered so many genuinely wonderful, helpful, content people.</resource>
  <resource id="32.698">Everything from trying to order a baguette in the morning (my Francais is tres terrible) to asking directions or talking to cabbies, we were always pleasantly surprised at how open and welcoming they were.</resource>
  <resource id="32.699">And they all seem to really enjoy their city.</resource>
  <resource id="32.700">They know how beautiful it is, and they appreciate it.</resource>
  <resource id="32.701">And man, it is gorgeous.</resource>
  <resource id="32.702">So many public spaces, parks museums, gardens.</resource>
  <resource id="32.703">And people are out in them all the time.</resource>
  <resource id="32.704">There was a fabulous sense of community there.</resource>
  <resource id="32.705">My favorite part about the city parks were the 'nap chairs'.</resource>
  <resource id="32.706">We had spent four hours in the Louvre, and were totally fried, couldn't see any more art.</resource>
  <resource id="32.707">So we went across the street to the park, it was about 2:00 pm.</resource>
  <resource id="32.708">There were people all over the place, and lots of benches and chairs.</resource>
  <resource id="32.709">We noticed that about half of the chairs were slanted at a 45 degree angle.</resource>
  <resource id="32.710">I thought: "that's strange, what's that about?"</resource>
  <resource id="32.711">We found out when we headed over to two of these chairs that were situated in the shade, and plopped down.</resource>
  <resource id="32.712">They were perfect for taking a catnap.</resource>
  <resource id="32.713">We looked around and noticed that there were lots of people all over the park, in the municipal nap chairs, taking a snooze.</resource>
  <resource id="32.714">Well, when in Rome.</resource>
  <resource id="32.715">so we did the same.</resource>
  <resource id="32.716">Had a little hour sleep, got back up and headed back into the colossal Louvre for another few hours.</resource>
  <resource id="32.717">What other city would use tax payer dollars to provide napping chairs in a public park?</resource>
  <resource id="32.718">Vive la France!</resource>
  <resource id="32.719">We really had a ball in Paris.</resource>
  <resource id="32.720">We went to Versailles, we went to Notre Dame, and on a fabulous bike tour.</resource>
  <resource id="32.721">The most interesting thing we learned on the bike tour was that when the revolutionaries stormed the Bastille, there were only 7 prisoners left in it.</resource>
  <resource id="32.722">6 were petty thieves and the seventh was a boy whose father had sent him there for a few weeks as  disciplinary measure.</resource>
  <resource id="32.723">So the Revloution, and it's over 20,000 beheadings was all for the sake of 'liberating' 7 ne'er-do-wells.</resource>
  <resource id="32.724">Vive la Revolution!</resource>
  <resource id="32.725">Montmartre, the old bohemian artist district, five minutes from the Sacre Coeur Cathedral.</resource>
  <resource id="32.726">Every night after dinner we'd climb the hill to the cathedral and sit on the steps.</resource>
  <resource id="32.727">The Cathedral is the highest point in Paris, and from its northerly vantage point, you have the entire city spread out at your feet.</resource>
  <resource id="32.728">It's a pretty breathtaking sight.</resource>
  <resource id="32.729">On the steps there was always sort of an impromptu party with musicians and performers and other city-watchers gathering with a bottle of wine and a merry spirit.</resource>
  <resource id="32.730">Those evenings on the steps are some of my favorite memories from Paris.</resource>
  <resource id="32.731">So, after five tremendous days, we finally bid adieu to Pair-ee and boarded a plane back to Dallas.</resource>
  <resource id="32.732">Upon arrival back in the states, we changed clothes and went directly to a Counting Crows concert, which was my birthday present from Lance.</resource>
  <resource id="32.733">What an incredible end to an incredible journey.</resource>
  <resource id="32.734">Thus, is my two year Grande Tour at an end.</resource>
  <resource id="32.735">It took me to 11 different countries and incalculable new experiences.</resource>
  <resource id="32.736">I've returned ready for a fresh start, collecting new experiences on this side of the pond.</resource>
  <resource id="32.737">The last few weeks I've been in Lubbock, trying to readjust to life in America and spending lots of time with my family.</resource>
  <resource id="32.738">I was also lucky enough to be hired to direct a show for Frenship high school, which went up last Sunday.</resource>
  <resource id="32.739">It was a Commedia dell'Arte piece titled The Red Hat, and went extremely well.</resource>
  <resource id="32.740">It was a nice way for me to get to stretch those theater muscles and earn a little something at the same time.</resource>
  <resource id="32.741">And though my European adventure is over (for the moment) my American one starts tomorrow.</resource>
  <resource id="32.742">I'm moving to Chicago Sunday morning, in the hopes of getting started there as an director and performer.</resource>
  <resource id="32.743">I'm excited about the move, and the opportunities and challenges that await me there.</resource>
  <resource id="32.744">Well thanks for making it this far!</resource>
  <resource id="32.745">There was  a lot to pack in.</resource>
  <resource id="32.746">I hope all of you are well; that you have made it through the summer, and are excited about the upcoming (rapidly approaching) holiday season!</resource>
  <resource id="32.747">I'll be in New York for New Year's, so if you're going to be in that area, let me know and we'll ring it in together.</resource>
  <resource id="32.748">I wish you all a fabulous week, and a warm and safe start to the wintry season.</resource>
  <resource id="32.749">All the best till we meet again!</resource>

  <resource id="33.750">So.</resource>
  <resource id="33.751">first day of school.</resource>
  <resource id="33.752">Yeah.</resource>
  <resource id="33.753">My classes all seem fine.</resource>
  <resource id="33.754">Except math.</resource>
  <resource id="33.755">But math just sucks, and I've accepted that.</resource>
  <resource id="33.756">Some of my teachers seem quite amazing, and others I know for a fact to be amazing.</resource>
  <resource id="33.757">So, all-in-all, pretty good, right?</resource>
  <resource id="33.758">Except for the multitudes of awkward ex-boyfriend moments.</resource>
  <resource id="33.759">Honestly, while I was dating the child, I barely saw him in school.</resource>
  <resource id="33.760">Now, I see him all the time, and I'm pretty sure he'll be right outside the door my photography room after class every day for the rest of this trimester.</resource>
  <resource id="33.761">Unless Brandon and Meg break up, that is.  Which is unlikely, so I shouldn't even hope on that one.</resource>
  <resource id="33.762">I also found out that Junior year, will, in fact, be a bitch.</resource>
  <resource id="33.763">I have recieved homework in four of my seven classes.</resource>
  <resource id="33.764">AP World is going to be the hardest thing I'll ever do (academically, anyway).</resource>
  <resource id="33.765">Ah, well.</resource>
  <resource id="33.766">It's nothing a strong woman such as myself cannot handle with a little bit of DragonForce and mental pep talks.</resource>
  <resource id="33.767">("You can deal with this, Nyssa.</resource>
  <resource id="33.768">You climbed Mount fucking Desor with a nigh 60 pound backpack.</resource>
  <resource id="33.769">You can handle high school drama.") Also, I have so many friends, and all of them are true, caring, trustworthy friends who love me and are supporting me 100%.</resource>
  <resource id="33.770">I can come through this year triumphantly and with grace.</resource>
  <resource id="33.771">I have looked forward to this year even before last year ended.</resource>
  <resource id="33.772">This is the year where everything happens.</resource>
  <resource id="33.773">This is my year to be happy.</resource>
  <resource id="33.774">This is my year to try new things and to succeed!</resource>

  <resource id="33.797">I cannot believe the nerve of this man. God.</resource>

<block id="block 34">
  <resource id="34.802">Blar.</resource>
  <resource id="34.803">I am so irritated with the inefficiency and incompetancy of the world I live in.</resource>
  <resource id="34.804">I'm mostly pissed about how I paid $50 for a STACK OF PAPER (it wasn't even bound!</resource>
  <resource id="34.805">at least they punched holes in it) that is my BIO lab course "book."</resource>
  <resource id="34.806">What's even worse, it's copied so poorly that the last half inch of text on the far right side of the page is cut off, so as I try to read in preparation for the lab tomorrow I'm trying to coherently complete sentences and make sense of it all, which is often impossible because so much is left out.</resource>
  <resource id="34.807">AND we're required to have this new kind of remote control clicker which none of the libraries have for (free) check out, so I have to pay $20 (+$12.50 activation fee) for something that doesn't work consistently, eats batteries, and will provide me with 3 and a half months of use.</resource>
  <resource id="34.808">Again, makes me so angry.</resource>
  <resource id="34.809">That's like, four or five or more meals!</resource>
  <resource id="34.810">Or a new pair of jeans!</resource>
  <resource id="34.811">Or two meals in Europe.</resource>
  <resource id="34.812">Poopy poopy poopy.</resource>
  <resource id="34.813">Can you tell I buy books with my own money?</resource>
  <resource id="34.814">I feel sort of lame since my parents seem to pay for everything, but they actually don't.</resource>
  <resource id="34.815">They pay room and board, and tuition and that's it.</resource>
  <resource id="34.816">Which is the bulk of my expenses, but I'm paying for my food outside of campus meal plan food, and my books, and whatever else I need.</resource>
  <resource id="34.817">So I guess that counts for something.</resource>
  <resource id="34.818">I just worked so hard this summer and made a decent amount of money, and then to think about how one four hour private party barely covered one textbook?</resource>
  <resource id="34.819">*cries* Such is life I spose.</resource>
  <resource id="34.820">I am in such a bad mood and I'm playing the blame game in my head, getting angry at people for things that are really quite trivial.</resource>
  <resource id="34.821">It's the nighttime moodiness that seems to plague me so often, but this time I have all this schoolwork related stress that's already starting to build up.</resource>
  <resource id="34.822">I forgot how demeaning BME classes are.</resource>
  <resource id="34.823">Dr. Roy, my prof for BME 314 expects us to have taken an Anatomy/Physiology class at some point in our lives.</resource>
  <resource id="34.824">I haven't.</resource>
  <resource id="34.825">He was asking all these questions that I was completely baffled by and people were just spouting answers.</resource>
  <resource id="34.826">Sometimes I wonder how in the world I made it in, and every day I wonder how I'm going to make it through.</resource>
  <resource id="34.827">Matt and I decided that BME really isn't a good undergrad major, there's a reason it's generally proposed as a Master's degree.</resource>
  <resource id="34.828">I mean, we already need 133 (ish) hours to graduate which, for you non college people, is about 8-10 more than any engineering major and more than that more for a non engineering major.</resource>
  <resource id="34.829">In addition to that, we keep encountering classes where the professor expects you to have taken general classes that you haven't (the anatomy/physiology is one, and thermodynamics is another one that Matt is having a problem with).</resource>
  <resource id="34.830">I need to find a good time/place where I can go pray and unwind.</resource>
  <resource id="34.831">I dont' know where that is yet.</resource>
  <resource id="34.832">I don't feel like I ever have that kind of privacy where I can talk to God and cry and figure things out.</resource>
  <resource id="34.833">Crying is my reaction to extremes of all emotion.</resource>
  <resource id="34.834">Sadness is the most obvious, and happiness is probably next, but I cry a lot about other things too.</resource>
  <resource id="34.835">like at the beginning of the Lion King (the musical), the intro is just SO AMAZING, I wanted to cry.</resource>
  <resource id="34.836">Seems kind of ridiculous.</resource>
  <resource id="34.837">I always tear up in church too, for different reasons.</resource>
  <resource id="34.838">I love the way God brings people together.</resource>
  <resource id="34.839">I think it's the beauty.</resource>
  <resource id="34.840">People gathered in prayer is so humbling, I love it!</resource>
  <resource id="34.841">Worship too, when there's a verse a cappella and there's this huge room full of people singing, it's so powerful and I just want to cry</resource>
  <resource id="34.842">Ok. I'm feeling somewhat better now.</resource>
  <resource id="34.843">I'm going to finish my book before I go to bed.</resource>
  <resource id="34.844">Girls, I highly reccomend In Her Shoes, especially if you have a sister I'm enjoying it immensely and it has effectively distracted from my schoolwork almost all day.</resource>
  <resource id="34.845">I think I spent the better part of two hours reading today.</resource>
  <resource id="34.846">I learned that the Life Sciences library in the main building has exceedingly comfortable couches Anyhoo.</resource>
  <resource id="34.847">I spose I'm off for now.</resource>
  <resource id="34.848">Two harmless classes tomorrow and then that lovely 4 hour biology lab that I'm dreading.</resource>

<block id="block 57">
  <resource id="57.1">Right now, I'm sitting on a back deck overlooking a moderately busy street, smoking a cheap cigar, listening to music, letting its vibrations move my cogitations to.</resource>
  <resource id="57.2">wherever.</resource>
  <resource id="57.3">It's peaceful, relaxing, and, to a very small degree, depressing.</resource>
  <resource id="57.4">The cigar is getting shorter, the weather is getting colder, and the battery is draining.</resource>
  <resource id="57.5">Things end.</resource>
  <resource id="57.6">These small indicators remind me that, in the Silvia Plath sense of the concept, I'm dying.</resource>
  <resource id="57.7">Someday I will be no more than slime coating the expensive, cushiony, velvety inside of a coffin.</resource>
  <resource id="57.8">I foolishly presume that I have between sixty and eighty years of life left.</resource>
  <resource id="57.9">This is a foolish presumption because today I could easily die.</resource>
  <resource id="57.10">The rickety deck I'm sitting on could fall, I could catch a stray bullet to the noggin on my way to my car in the parking lot, I could be nailed by a drunk, inattentive, careless, or simply unfortunate driver on the way home.</resource>
  <resource id="57.11">These are all unlikely, but they happen.</resource>
  <resource id="57.12">I see it everyday on the news.</resource>
  <resource id="57.13">My mortality is nothing new, but I constantly have to ponder what I desire to take, achieve, or feel in this life.</resource>
  <resource id="57.14">My current philosophy is to live as much as possible, to feel as much as I can whether socially frowned or smiled upon.</resource>
  <resource id="57.15">Do I want to die being someone that took or contributed?</resource>
  <resource id="57.16">Should I strive to be in someone's history book as the dude that invented.</resource>
  <resource id="57.17">rebuilt.</resource>
  <resource id="57.18">destroyed.</resource>
  <resource id="57.19">saved.</resource>
  <resource id="57.20">rescued.</resource>
  <resource id="57.21">wrote.</resource>
  <resource id="57.22">governed.</resource>
  <resource id="57.23">or do I simply want to live an average American life and be remembered under a large stone in a well kept cemetery, forgotten after my immediate reletaves, children, and grand children.</resource>
  <resource id="57.24">I could live in a suburban house environment with a family, a few cars, a boat, and a dog in the back yard?</resource>
  <resource id="57.25">Should I travel to faroff places that have interested me? England, France, Norway, Sweden, Lebanon, Israel, the Vatican?</resource>
  <resource id="57.26">Or should I sink my money into trying to acquire more and live in a Parade of Homes house with yuppie vehicles in the front, a Mastercraft boat with a huge ski rack, the list can go on and on.</resource>
  <resource id="57.27">What happens when I die?</resource>
  <resource id="57.28">Does an afterlife really exist?</resource>
  <resource id="57.29">I currently attend church(grumbling and complaining the whole way) about one of every four Sundays.</resource>
  <resource id="57.30">That's one hour a week.</resource>
  <resource id="57.31">Should I start devoting myself to God, if there is such a being, in hopes of making it to Heaven?</resource>
  <resource id="57.32">There would be a constant trepedation that there is no gold at the end of that rainbow.</resource>
  <resource id="57.33">Different songs keep on playing.</resource>
  <resource id="57.34">A blues/hiphop from Everlast, with Whitey Ford's deep voice and fingerstrumming guitar, a dance mix with Sarah Mclachlan's distressed, sad, and graceful vocals keeping interest to what would otherwise be an empty, ignored bass thump, Kurt Cobain's guttural screams and rasping to lively drums and changing guitars, Layne Staley's haunting, unmatched vocals to a rainy sound, 311's calming take on reggae.</resource>
  <resource id="57.35">Each song brings on a different mood, whether I consciously monitor each sound and search the music for what's expressed, or simply put it off as background noise.</resource>
  <resource id="57.36">My shirt is off, and my sensitivity to each change in the athmosphere is heightned fourfold to what I detect when I'm fully clothed.</resource>
  <resource id="57.37">My cigar is gone, and for my health(and because of unwillingness to blow another three bucks), it will probably be another two weeks before I smoke again, regardless of how much I enjoy them.</resource>
  <resource id="57.38">No wonder past writers were able to produce their amazing feats of feeling and thought.</resource>
  <resource id="57.39">Their distractions were very limited.</resource>
  <resource id="57.40">My thoughts at the moment are somewhat melancholy, but can be completely forgotten at the push of a button mounted to an  Xbox, Dvd player, or VCR.</resource>
  <resource id="57.41">For the laziness in me, I feel compelled to fold my laptop, plug it in, and simply watch, but this whole trainwreck, a malformed offspring of a feeble mind, has to come to an end somehow.</resource>
  <resource id="57.42">The first words that come to mind are "in closing" or "to conclude", and then I quickly write a summary of what I just finished writing.</resource>
  <resource id="57.43">Maybe I should stop in mid sentence, just to</resource>

<block id="block 58">
  <resource id="58.44">Its been an interesting couple of weeks.</resource>
  <resource id="58.45">I am now the proud father of Daisy Alexandria Davolls.</resource>
  <resource id="58.46">Its all official, we sorted it out at the civic centre on Friday.</resource>
  <resource id="58.47">Going through childbirth with none of the pain was a strange, removed experience, but I have emotionally bonded with Daisy beyond measure.</resource>
  <resource id="58.48">You might not of seen A.I the pony peter pan rip off, but when the "owner" of the robot boy makes him emotionally attach to her by speaking the words and codes etc. well its like someone has done that.</resource>
  <resource id="58.49">I now have a sweet little thing, that totally depends on her mum and me to do whats best.</resource>
  <resource id="58.50">I have the foresight of Supernanny and Honey we're killing the kids etc to thank as well as my own morals and my parents and peers too.</resource>
  <resource id="58.51">Its a funny old game life, but I think I am one step closer to understanding its purpose and meaning now.</resource>
  <resource id="58.52">I had a long hard look at my life over the last 14 days, and to be honest I wept.</resource>
  <resource id="58.53">I wept for all the mistakes I made where I put my feelings before the feelings of others.</resource>
  <resource id="58.54">I wept for all the times I said "f*ck you" instead of "thank you".</resource>
  <resource id="58.55">I've lost my smoke, but I am keeping my fire.</resource>
  <resource id="58.56">I still have a couple of vices, strong coffee and noodles, but have quit smoking, havent drunk for a couple of weeks and am feeling better about life.</resource>
  <resource id="58.57">My job is going really well, and I am getting a kick out of both going to work and coming home.</resource>
  <resource id="58.58">The pessimist in me awaits the phone call from the police or hospital or nuclear plant etc telling me the worst, crushing my hopes of a better tomorrow.</resource>
  <resource id="58.59">But the real me, for the time being at least, is at peace.</resource>

  <resource id="59.60">what is happiness</resource>
  <resource id="59.61">can you buy it?</resource>
  <resource id="59.62">can it be sold?</resource>
  <resource id="59.63">can you get there and back on a half tank of gas?</resource>
  <resource id="59.64">I think you can.</resource>
  <resource id="59.65">Funny how you can give happiness - but you can only take it away from yourself.</resource>
  <resource id="59.66">We are all essentially the same person.</resource>
  <resource id="59.67">other then physical attributes - what really makes us so different from one another.</resource>
  <resource id="59.68">Theoretically.</resource>
  <resource id="59.69">is there anything that Einstein did that I couldn't do.</resource>
  <resource id="59.70">we both have the same tools (a brain) so why can't I come up with a grad theory of relativity.</resource>
  <resource id="59.71">Simply because that is not where I have been directing my energy to.</resource>
  <resource id="59.72">The brain is an amazing tool and can be sculpted for any purpose.</resource>
  <resource id="59.73">however most people don't exert the mental energy required to expand your train of thought.</resource>
  <resource id="59.74">I believe all brains start out with the same potential and the way they are grown and shaped determined how they operate on default for the rest of your life unless you do something about it.</resource>
  <resource id="59.75">Have you ever met anyone without a fully developed brain?</resource>
  <resource id="59.76">How happy they seem.</resource>
  <resource id="59.77">They look at things only on the surface and read into nothing.</resource>
  <resource id="59.78">Listlessly they scratch at there head and the chains of thought don't delve to deep.</resource>
  <resource id="59.79">Do they know how lucky they are - to find contentment without looking.</resource>
  <resource id="59.80">The more you think - the harder it becomes to find happiness.</resource>
  <resource id="59.81">more often you find things to bring you down or worry about.</resource>
  <resource id="59.82">Worrying about the future is pointless - there are things that are going to happen that are beyond your control or ability to predict.</resource>
  <resource id="59.83">A single lightning bolt from the sky can make a lifetime of panic and worry all worthless.</resource>
  <resource id="59.84">If you can't enjoy your time here - then what is the point of being?</resource>
  <resource id="59.85">I think it is very easy to understand people once you realize that all people carry all the same personalities - just expressed to different proportions and degrees.</resource>
  <resource id="59.86">Whatever thought can be imagined - someone has taken that to the extreme.</resource>
  <resource id="59.87">True wisdom is growing your brain in all directions.</resource>
  <resource id="59.88">Experiencing love, jealousy, forgiveness, hate, wrath, and compassion but exemplifying none of them.</resource>
  <resource id="59.89">Life is finding the balance between compulsion and carelessness.</resource>
  <resource id="59.90">An underdeveloped brain experiences happiness - a more developed one becomes worried - only a fully developed brain can experience acceptance.</resource>
  <resource id="59.91">I am not saying I am anything other then happy - but I strive for a balance.</resource>
  <resource id="59.92">the perfect combination of all attributes.</resource>
  <resource id="59.93">the combination of all people balanced into one.</resource>
  <resource id="59.94">as defined by the dictionary</resource>
  <resource id="59.95">Balanced.</resource>
  <resource id="59.96">(of a person or state of mind) having no emotion lacking or too strong; stable : a balanced personality.</resource>
  <resource id="59.97">Happiness comes from within - your brain is a self regulating chemical factory.</resource>
  <resource id="59.98">but when you try to become your own mental chemist - ingesting chemicals to alter your feelings - you screw up the balance.</resource>
  <resource id="59.99">If you start taking a chemical to make you happier - your body stops producing that chemical on its own.</resource>
  <resource id="59.100">This phenomenon can best be seen and proved with steroid users.</resource>
  <resource id="59.101">The testes stop producing testosterone because it senses there is already too much testosterone in the system.</resource>
  <resource id="59.102">as a result - the balls shrink up and shut down.</resource>
  <resource id="59.103">The body is lazy - if you provide something for it - it stops providing for itself.</resource>
  <resource id="59.104">For example - the more you use chapstick - the less your lips produce their own moisture - making you further dependent on chapstick.</resource>
  <resource id="59.105">it is an evil circle I know.</resource>
  <resource id="59.106">So while Cliche it is true.</resource>
  <resource id="59.107">"Happiness lies within" - the only way to be truly happy is to create it yourself and not rely on other people or things.</resource>
  <resource id="59.108">the Happiness they bring is only temporary.</resource>
  <resource id="59.109">Yet often that temporary happiness is more intense then a balanced contentment.</resource>
  <resource id="59.110">It is however usually accompanied by and equal sadness - it is life's way of balancing itself out in the endless pendulum swing of life.</resource>

  <resource id="60.111">So, this morning I get a phone call from my sister.</resource>
  <resource id="60.112">First she is all mad because I haven't called her back in a week.</resource>
  <resource id="60.113">Second of all she is laughing hysterically because she had to put her dog on doggie drugs because the dog learned how to open the window to get out and seems to be jewish because she likes the temple down the road.</resource>
  <resource id="60.114">Third she starts asking why I have only posted pics, so my dear sister, this is for you.</resource>
  <resource id="60.115">She wouldn;t come down today so instead of being bored out of my mind I went antiquing.</resource>
  <resource id="60.116">I figure I have a couple extra bucks so I budget a certain amount.</resource>
  <resource id="60.117">Ok, I spent 4 times what I budgeted, but I wanted that desk.</resource>
  <resource id="60.118">Now I have to figure out where the hell to put it.</resource>
  <resource id="60.119">I almost bought this cool shiney glass "tumbler up" thingy.</resource>
  <resource id="60.120">I was dragged away, (it will be there tomorrow and I can go back alone).</resource>
  <resource id="60.121">Ok, I finish up this case this week where the lady is demanding the dealership's head on a platter.</resource>
  <resource id="60.122">Ok, the alignment was out on her BMW when she bought it and it wiped out the tires.</resource>
  <resource id="60.123">She didn;t give the dealer a chance to correct the problem, she paid a astronomical amount for new tires without telling the dealer and expected the dealer to reimburse her the full amount.</resource>
  <resource id="60.124">I tend to think not.</resource>
  <resource id="60.125">Then she starts lying to me about the condition of her car.</resource>
  <resource id="60.126">She said that a mechanic told her that the frame was bent.</resource>
  <resource id="60.127">I called the mechanic and inquired about it.</resource>
  <resource id="60.128">A shock mount was bad.</resource>
  <resource id="60.129">On that car, it won't affect alignment.</resource>
  <resource id="60.130">She started questioning my credentials because she drives a school bus for a living and knows what a safe vehicle is. Bitch.</resource>
  <resource id="60.131">I am more than qualified to do my job.</resource>
  <resource id="60.132">I have twice the work experience required for the job and I have alot more schooling than is required.</resource>

  <resource id="60.134">I got her less than $500.00 back.</resource>
  <resource id="60.135">She's not happy, but I do apathy very well.</resource>
  <resource id="60.136">Bitch.</resource>
  <resource id="60.137">She's not going to like the report I write if she decides to get a copy for the civil suit she is planning on pressing on the dealership.</resource>
  <resource id="60.138">I am not kind to her.</resource>
  <resource id="60.139">So when she writes her letter to the Commissioner and the director of vehicle safety reads my report, he will understand why I appear not to take her side.</resource>
  <resource id="60.140">I made lunch for a luncheon at work yesterday.</resource>
  <resource id="60.141">Cook up lamb for gyros.</resource>
  <resource id="60.142">It must have been liked, my regional director ate far more than anyone else.</resource>
  <resource id="60.143">I said that the tzatziki sauce I made had too much garlic, good thing they all like garlic.</resource>
  <resource id="60.144">They saw what I meant when they started eating it.</resource>
  <resource id="60.145">They went back for more.</resource>
  <resource id="60.146">As far as i can tell, it was a success.</resource>
  <resource id="60.147">They all complimented on it.</resource>
  <resource id="60.148">I told a friend of mine this week that I have a soft spot on my heart for him.</resource>
  <resource id="60.149">He called me mushy.</resource>
  <resource id="60.150">Killin me he is. He's a great guy and I want to marry him for his kitchen, he liked that one, hahaha.</resource>
  <resource id="60.151">Well, what can I say, he has a great kitchen, and the best cooking stuff, he doesn't even cook.</resource>
  <resource id="60.152">He's a great guy and I think the world of him.</resource>
  <resource id="60.153">The cool part is, we both hate crowds, so we hang and watch tv and hike and avoid other people, of course he gets pissy when I mention going to walmart.</resource>
  <resource id="60.154">I'm hoping he reads this turns all red (he does that).</resource>
  <resource id="60.155">Ok, I've said enough.</resource>
  <resource id="60.156">I need to figure what I'm going to throw out so I can move that desk from the middle of the dining room to one of the 2 rooms upstairs I occupy.</resource>

  <resource id="62.161">Our emotions are a gift from God.</resource>
  <resource id="62.162">When emotions are allowed to work as they are intended to work they can bless us and others in many ways.</resource>
  <resource id="62.163">But in order to recieve the blessing we must first realize that our emotions are always connected to a need being met or unmet.</resource>
  <resource id="62.164">By listening to our emotions and asking ourselves why we are feeling a particular emotion we can discover an unmet need or a need that has been satisfied.</resource>
  <resource id="62.165">For instance, if I feel sad because I have not seen my family in a long time my need for connection has not been met.</resource>
  <resource id="62.166">On the otherhand, if I feel happy because I have spent time with my family then my need for connection has been met.</resource>
  <resource id="62.167">Yet, many times we do not listen to our emotions and completely ignore them and/or act violently towards others as a result of not looking at the need we have.</resource>
  <resource id="62.168">How many times have we felt angry and as a result insulted, judged, criticized, blamed or physically hurt someone?</resource>
  <resource id="62.169">Probably too many to count.</resource>
  <resource id="62.170">Many of us don't know what to do when we feel angry, furious, frustrated, hopeless, lonely, despondent and many other emotions because no one has taught us what to do.</resource>
  <resource id="62.171">We live in a society that has encourages us to stuff our emotions and a society that is by the most part feelings illiterate.</resource>
  <resource id="62.172">So, what can we do?</resource>
  <resource id="62.173">Well, for starters become aware of what we are feeling.</resource>
  <resource id="62.174">When we are upset we can simply ask ourselves, "What am I feeling?"</resource>
  <resource id="62.175">We can become conscious of what is going on inside us.</resource>
  <resource id="62.176">Once we put our finger on the emotion we are feeling we can then go on to vocalize it.</resource>
  <resource id="62.177">Marshall Rosenberg, author of Nonviolent Communication, has a four-step process for communication that incorporates identifying our feelings and needs into the model.</resource>
  <resource id="62.178">Part of that model involves asking the question, "I am feeling _______ because I am needing ______."</resource>
  <resource id="62.179">So, what we can do when we are feeling upset is ask ourselves, "What am I feeling and needing right now?" or say, "I am feeling _______ because I am needing __________."</resource>
  <resource id="62.180">Rosenberg also calls this four step process "giraffe language."</resource>
  <resource id="62.181">He coined it giraffe language because the giraffe has the largest heart of all the mammals.</resource>
  <resource id="62.182">The heart is about 3 feet long and 3 inches thick all around.</resource>
  <resource id="62.183">The idea is that Nonviolent communication, which focuses on feelings and needs is the language of the heart because it focuses on what is alive in the heart.</resource>
  <resource id="62.184">When we focus on our feelings and needs we also avoid focusing on what others are saying or doing that is bothering us.</resource>
  <resource id="62.185">By stating our feelings and needs to others we avoid blaming and criticizing them.</resource>
  <resource id="62.186">We can then go on to making a request instead of a demand to help ourselves satisfy our now recognized need.</resource>
  <resource id="62.187">When others are angry or upset with us we can also use this technique on them.</resource>
  <resource id="62.188">We can ask them, "Are you feeling ______ because you are needing _______?"</resource>
  <resource id="62.189">They will appreciate that we are focusing on them and let us know if we are right.</resource>
  <resource id="62.190">If we are not correct they will correct us and we will be closer to identifying the need they have and finding a way to resolve the situation.</resource>
  <resource id="62.191">By satisfying our needs and the needs of others we can reach a fair negotiation.</resource>
  <resource id="62.192">Another thing that we can do is become aware of certain feelings that have had a tendency in the past to trigger negative actions toward ourselves and others.</resource>
  <resource id="62.193">We can make a list of these feelings and be on the look out for them.</resource>
  <resource id="62.194">It may be that we need to take a timeout when we feel these feelings to avoid a conflict.</resource>
  <resource id="62.195">For instance, if we feel furious it may be better to take a one hour timeout and calm down.</resource>
  <resource id="62.196">Then when we are calm, focus on sharing our feelings and needs with others.</resource>
  <resource id="62.197">Many times in the past we have reacted like a lion when we feel angry or frustrated with others or ourselves.</resource>
  <resource id="62.198">Taking time to focus on our feelings and needs helps us not let the lion out and speak from the heart that language of the giraffe with ourselves and others.</resource>

<block id="block 65">
  <resource id="65.260">The subject has rocked Europe like few other 'cultural clashes' that i have witnessed since escaping the yankees in Bolivia.</resource>
  <resource id="65.261">It's yet another white man insensitivity subject that even has socialists and revolutionaries saying 'hey, hold on a second!'.</resource>
  <resource id="65.262">It's the veils.</resource>
  <resource id="65.263">Yes, the veils that many Muslim women around the world traditionally wear.</resource>
  <resource id="65.264">I'm not going to get into the wrongs and rights, just to give a bit of perspective.</resource>
  <resource id="65.265">Listen.</resource>
  <resource id="65.266">I see the words veil and headscarf being used by white Europeans in many contradictory contexts.</resource>
  <resource id="65.267">Let's clarify.</resource>
  <resource id="65.268">Hijab is a headscarf that covers the hair and usually wraps around the neck.</resource>
  <resource id="65.269">The veil is often interpreted as being the ninja outfit, where womens heads are completely covered so as to see only the eyes, or in some cases nothing at all.</resource>
  <resource id="65.270">Taleban style if you will.</resource>
  <resource id="65.271">This is called the nikab.</resource>
  <resource id="65.272">Westerners use the word veil for both things, get it straight whitey.</resource>
  <resource id="65.273">So opposition to the veil isn't even a clear issue from within the opposing side.</resource>
  <resource id="65.274">For clarification the difference should be noted.</resource>
  <resource id="65.275">Hijab in Islam actually means modesty or privacy.</resource>
  <resource id="65.276">And it is believed that women should practice modesty both for themselves but to keep the gazing eyes of man down.</resource>
  <resource id="65.277">The khimar is the actual headscarf.</resource>
  <resource id="65.278">The veil that covers the entire face is called the nikab.</resource>
  <resource id="65.279">Islam requires women to be modest, henceforth many of them wear the hijab, or headscarf.</resource>
  <resource id="65.280">The nikab, or taliban style cover, is not an Islamic practice.</resource>
  <resource id="65.281">A Fatwa, or Islamic legal pronouncement makes it clear that women are not obliged to wear nikab - but rather this is a cultural issue within more conservative or radical interpretations of Islam (just like the west has some Christian right wackies).</resource>
  <resource id="65.282">The French caused an awefully painful row within their already highly strained relations with French Muslims, mainly of northern Africa descent, by banning hijabs in public schools.</resource>
  <resource id="65.283">It most certainly raised even more anti-Muslim sentiment but also more anti-French sentiment even amongst it own non-Christian communities.</resource>
  <resource id="65.284">Whether the French will ever admit it or not, they have a serious racism problem - and its aimed mainly at Muslims and Africans.</resource>
  <resource id="65.285">The Germans have passed similar laws, much to the dismay of its large Turkish-Muslim population.</resource>
  <resource id="65.286">The Brits, famous for their true melting pot status amongst the Europeans, have began treading in this murky water.</resource>
  <resource id="65.287">Jack Straw is calling for a ban of veils, or nikabs, in the UK.</resource>
  <resource id="65.288">Not the ban on hijabs.</resource>
  <resource id="65.289">The well integrated, but edgy Muslim community is not so happy about this.</resource>
  <resource id="65.290">With the ultra liberal socialist mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, even backing the idea - I think many Muslims see it as the drawn sword.</resource>
  <resource id="65.291">And I'm afraid it could get ugly.</resource>
  <resource id="65.292">But if the UK Muslims are listening to Mr. Livingstone, he's on to something.</resource>
  <resource id="65.293">He clearly stated that he feels the veils should go -- but that it should be over a period of time and from within the Muslim community.</resource>
  <resource id="65.294">It shouldn't, he added, be decided by a group of old white male politicians.</resource>
  <resource id="65.295">Not to mention that many Muslim women scholars are saying women should thank Jack Straw for this.</resource>
  <resource id="65.296">I'm by no means an expert on veils.</resource>
  <resource id="65.297">What i do know is that there are many, many woman who absolutely voluntarily and willingly cover themselves with a headscarf for religious purposes.</resource>
  <resource id="65.298">Most of the European peasantry covered themselves with a headscarf just a hundred years ago and can still be found in christian villages throughout eastern and southern europe.</resource>
  <resource id="65.299">It is also true that many Muslim cultures in the world 'oblige' their women to wear the veil.</resource>
  <resource id="65.300">So the voluntary and involuntary.</resource>
  <resource id="65.301">Willing and unwilling.</resource>
  <resource id="65.302">France says no head scarves, no nothing -- look like a sexy french school girl with your belly button hanging out.</resource>
  <resource id="65.303">The Brits haven't ventured that far, they accept the head scarf, but oppose the ninja turtle look.</resource>
  <resource id="65.304">Turkey has a similar issue.</resource>
  <resource id="65.305">In its bid to become a secular society -- and to integrate into the unwelcoming arms of the European Union, it has forbidden even the nikab and in some places even the hijab in public schools and universities.</resource>
  <resource id="65.306">Sarajevo now has a large female Turkish population coming to study here so they can wear what they wish.</resource>
  <resource id="65.307">This to me is a fascinating occurance.</resource>
  <resource id="65.308">The west, so-called champions of democracy, freedom of expression and religio,n is on the attack - or as some percieve on the defensive - when Islam is in question.</resource>
  <resource id="65.309">Sarajevo and Bosnia enjoys the best of both worlds.</resource>
  <resource id="65.310">It is Europe's largest 'indigenous' Muslim population, all of whom are white Europeans and embrace European principles.</resource>
  <resource id="65.311">Bosnian Islam is very secular, and indeed seen by most European leaders as a model example of the type of Islam they want being taught in their increasing number of mosques and madressa's within the EU.</resource>
  <resource id="65.312">The question of hijab and nikabs hasn't come up yet here in Bosnia.</resource>
  <resource id="65.313">The hijab is accepted and tolerated, as are the nikab wearers (which is an extremely small percentage of Muslim women).</resource>
  <resource id="65.314">The progressive west is certainly faltering when it comes to questions of its growing Muslim populations and addressing the cultural and religious difference between east and west.</resource>
  <resource id="65.315">The Muslims too have yet to seriously address the fears and concerns of 'indigenous' white westerners - who have opened their doors from some of the worlds worst economically and socially oppressed societies.</resource>
  <resource id="65.316">This door has to swing both ways.</resource>
  <resource id="65.317">The west must do more to grasp the concepts of Islam - and understand the vast cultural differences even with the large and diverse Muslim community, which covers three continents.</resource>
  <resource id="65.318">Muslims too need to understand the fears and concerns of secular westerners who now have to deal with strict Islamic rules within their own communities.</resource>
  <resource id="65.319">If western women can run around half naked, can eastern women completely cover themselves?</resource>
  <resource id="65.320">Is there really a difference?</resource>
  <resource id="65.321">There is no black and white my friends.</resource>
  <resource id="65.322">We all need to take the veils off.</resource>
  <resource id="65.323">and look at each other eye to eye.</resource>
  <resource id="65.324">Brother to brother, face to face, let's unite the human race.</resource>

  <resource id="67.335">Well, my MIL arrived yesterday.</resource>
  <resource id="67.336">So far things are going well.</resource>
  <resource id="67.337">The one bad thing is that she got news this morning that her 21 y/o kitty, Aunt Becky, passed away last night.</resource>
  <resource id="67.338">She knew the kitty was not doing well (she hasn't been for a while now, but kept rallying), so it wasn't a shock at all, but still sad.</resource>
  <resource id="67.339">She had been looking at having to have her PTS before she leaves for Africa, but I guess Aunt Becky had other ideas.</resource>
  <resource id="67.340">She said the kitty cuddled with her and purred all night Thursday night.</resource>
  <resource id="67.341">I think Aunt Becky was waiting for my MIL to leave yesterday for her trip here.</resource>
  <resource id="67.342">Aunt Becky was sent over the bridge in a traditional Anishinaabe (Ojibwe/Chippewa) ceremony.</resource>
  <resource id="67.343">Aagii, my MIL's neighbor, is of the Bear Clan and is very traditional in her ways.</resource>
  <resource id="67.344">She wrapped Aunt Becky in ceremonial cloth with 4 different herbs and buried her down by the creek that runs behind their homes in Topanga Canyon.</resource>
  <resource id="67.345">Aagii then sang the songs of her tribe that are intended to release the soul.</resource>
  <resource id="67.346">I would have loved to have been there to experience that.</resource>
  <resource id="67.347">I think it is wonderful that Aagii would do that for an animal that is not her own, but she is somebody who really respects nature and tries her best to live in harmony with it.</resource>
  <resource id="67.348">My SIL and niece came over yesterday afternoon to collect our great-nephew, Brandon.</resource>
  <resource id="67.349">Daddybear refused to let them take the baby!</resource>
  <resource id="67.350">He has been working all week and has not had much time to play with Brandon and get his baby fix (yes, B is 3 y/o, but anything under 4 is a baby to Daddybear).</resource>
  <resource id="67.351">He wanted B to stay at least for today so that he had a day off to play with him.</resource>
  <resource id="67.352">Brandon's dad, Michael, is improving.</resource>
  <resource id="67.353">They still are not sure what is going on with the transplanted kidney as it appears to be "peeling like an onion", but his potassium and sugar and such are leveling out and he is feeling better.</resource>

  <resource id="68.358">Do you know the feeling?</resource>
  <resource id="68.359">So last week was the Thanksgiving long weekend and it was sooo sweeeet.</resource>
  <resource id="68.360">My sister came back from university and it was (surprisingly) nice to spend time with her again!!</resource>
  <resource id="68.361">lol just kidding.</resource>
  <resource id="68.362">I spent it mostly with my family and we just went for some sightseeing and driving to random places.</resource>
  <resource id="68.363">I find that as I grow older I become more and more thankful for everything that God has blessed me with in my life, because I understand that they can be taken away at any time and we really should not take them for granted.</resource>
  <resource id="68.364">Especially people.</resource>
  <resource id="68.365">never take your friends or family for granted because they're basically all you have on Earth.</resource>
  <resource id="68.366">Anyways, on Monday I got to see some of my favourite people and that was really fun as well :) Go Augustine Inc.!</resource>
  <resource id="68.367">So I found out some exciting news yesterday from Pastor King.</resource>
  <resource id="68.368">I might be going to Montreal in November to do some more dance missionary :) I really pray that this trip will happen because ever since I came back from Montreal, I've felt a yearning to serve God again with one of the things I do best.</resource>
  <resource id="68.369">And I believe that God gave me this amazing opportunity for a specific reason and there's no way I'm turning it down.</resource>
  <resource id="68.370">Please just pray for me and the trip and the other people who are going (I'm not sure who yet so I shall keep it on the DL.</resource>
  <resource id="68.371">lol).</resource>
  <resource id="68.372">Anyway, this past week has been one of the busiest ones yet for me, and maybe for you too.</resource>
  <resource id="68.373">I just feel like we're all getting caught in the whirlpool of life (hehe what a funny term) and I just wanted to urge you guys to not forget about checking up on each other.</resource>
  <resource id="68.374">Sometimes, all we need is that little encouragement or motivation to get us going again.</resource>
  <resource id="68.375">like the energizer bunny!!!</resource>
  <resource id="68.376">:D lol wow.</resource>
  <resource id="68.377">Besides from that random addition by my kooky self I hope you know what I'm trying to get at, because I know for me, that's how it is. I need you guys to help me through!</resource>
  <resource id="68.378">Okay that's about it for now.</resource>
  <resource id="68.379">I love you all and goodbye.</resource>

<block id="block 69">
  <resource id="69.380">First of all, I would like to say that I am proud of myself.</resource>
  <resource id="69.381">What I completed in one day today, was not possible to me last week.</resource>
  <resource id="69.382">Today, I can say I actually taught for all three of my periods.</resource>
  <resource id="69.383">Here is a run down of my overhwhelming, but wonderful day:</resource>
  <resource id="69.384">I walked into my first period only to find a sub.</resource>
  <resource id="69.385">I decided then and there that I would take advantage of the situation and teach the class.</resource>
  <resource id="69.386">I asked the sub if he did not mind my taking over, and of course he complied.</resource>
  <resource id="69.387">I figured I knew the material more than he did, and more importantly I knew the students and how the class should run.</resource>
  <resource id="69.388">So the bell rang, the sub introduced himself and I took over.</resource>
  <resource id="69.389">I had them write in their journals for a few minutes, then proceeded to facilitate the day's assignments.</resource>
  <resource id="69.390">I allowed them 10-15 minutes to finish up the work from yesterday before we began a new piece of literature.</resource>
  <resource id="69.391">After they turned that in, I introduced "Poor Richard's Almanac," which we read as a class.</resource>
  <resource id="69.392">This was a very short reading so I gave the class an assignment to go along with the reading.</resource>
  <resource id="69.393">They had the remainder of the class to complete the assignment while I went around to monitor their work and answer questions.</resource>
  <resource id="69.394">The period ran smoothly under my direction most suprisingly to me. I actually liked being thrown into the situation without having prior knowledge.</resource>
  <resource id="69.395">On the other hand, I did know that today I was to teach a full period lesson to my freshmen for periods 3 &amp; 6.</resource>
  <resource id="69.396">For today's lesson I taught them how to determine the mood in a piece of literature based on the definition, an example, and a story out of their literature books.</resource>
  <resource id="69.397">I began my lesson by explaining what the term "mood" meant.</resource>
  <resource id="69.398">I explained to them that the "mood" of the story could be determined based on the word choice used by the author.</resource>
  <resource id="69.399">To give them a better understanding of how "mood" works, I presented them with a paragraph that I wrote on the overhead.</resource>
  <resource id="69.400">I had them follow along as I read out loud.</resource>
  <resource id="69.401">After I was done reading my paragraph, I had the students tell me what was the mood I had created.</resource>
  <resource id="69.402">Almost everyone participated, and for every type of mood they came up with, I had them point out places in the paragraph that helped them to determine the mood.</resource>
  <resource id="69.403">My example worked well.</resource>
  <resource id="69.404">That was a segway into today's story.</resource>
  <resource id="69.405">Today we read, "The Talk" by Gary Soto.</resource>
  <resource id="69.406">I gave a brief background on the author and the story before we began.</resource>
  <resource id="69.407">I read the first paragraph, then I drew names out of my little tin container to complete the reading.</resource>
  <resource id="69.408">After certain spots, I would have them go over plot summary just to make sure they were following along.</resource>
  <resource id="69.409">At the end of the story, I had them do the same thing they did with my paragraph to determine the mood.</resource>
  <resource id="69.410">After a discussion, I asked them to take out a piece of paper.</resource>
  <resource id="69.411">I had them answer a question along the lines of, "how would the mood of the story have been different if Soto wrote this as a child?"</resource>
  <resource id="69.412">They answered on their papers, then shared out as a class.</resource>
  <resource id="69.413">This completed my very first lesson for periods 3 &amp; 6.</resource>

<block id="block 70">
  <resource id="70.414">Wow, I hardly ever have plans.</resource>
  <resource id="70.415">I went to the OVAC volleyball tournament this morning, and was gone almost all day, and I'm going skating with one of my friends tonight.</resource>
  <resource id="70.416">Got to go out for breakfast with the team, even though I'm not a member.</resource>
  <resource id="70.417">I'm the libero tracker.</resource>
  <resource id="70.418">The libero is a defensive specialist and I have to keep track of who she goes in and out for.</resource>
  <resource id="70.419">Kind of boring, but I like having something to do.</resource>
  <resource id="70.420">And the parents' club decided to pay for our breakfasts, so I got a free buffet!</resource>
  <resource id="70.421">^___^ And then my friend (the libero)'s mom bought me a shirt.</resource>
  <resource id="70.422">I tried to pay her back, but she wouldn't let me. So I got a free spiffin' sweet green tie-dyed OVAC shirt, too.</resource>
  <resource id="70.423">Today rocks!</resource>
  <resource id="70.424">I can't wait to go skating.</resource>
  <resource id="70.425">I was gonna call my best friend and see if she wanted to go, but she wasn't there.</resource>
  <resource id="70.426">I thought she was going shopping today.</resource>
  <resource id="70.427">She's not a skating-type person, though.</resource>
  <resource id="70.428">We always try to get her to come, but it doesn't work.</resource>
  <resource id="70.429">We'll just have to drag her down to the rink one of these days, lol!</resource>
  <resource id="70.430">I love skating.</resource>
  <resource id="70.431">I always fall on my ass every five minutes, though.</resource>
  <resource id="70.432">x.x I need to invest in a pair of blades.</resource>
  <resource id="70.433">I outgrew my skates, and I don't like renting.</resource>
  <resource id="70.434">Plus, I've heard blades are easier than four-wheels and I can use all the help I can get.</resource>
  <resource id="70.435">o___x</resource>

  <resource id="71.437">What can I say?</resource>
  <resource id="71.438">She's amazing.</resource>
  <resource id="71.439">Like, most definetely on my top favorite authors list.</resource>
  <resource id="71.440">This list is very short.</resource>
  <resource id="71.441">In fact, there's only about three authors whose books I will buy, no matter the storyline.</resource>
  <resource id="71.442">Meyer, JK Rowling, and Meg Cabot.</resource>
  <resource id="71.443">And yes, I read hundreds, thousands of books from other people.</resource>

  <resource id="71.445">meh.</resource>
  <resource id="71.446">I can only dream of having half the talent that they do.</resource>
  <resource id="71.447">I'm a writer.</resource>
  <resource id="71.448">I love making up stories, retelling stories, and writing down everything.</resource>
  <resource id="71.449">But.</resource>
  <resource id="71.450">the thing is.  my work isn't spectacular.</resource>
  <resource id="71.451">I know that.</resource>
  <resource id="71.452">I'm enough of a grown-up to say it.</resource>
  <resource id="71.453">And after reading Stephenie's story about how real her characters are.</resource>
  <resource id="71.454">how they can "take over" her outlines.</resource>
  <resource id="71.455">mine pretty much are bland.</resource>
  <resource id="71.456">The story leads me, not the people who grace the page.</resource>
  <resource id="71.457">And Stephenie says that we should know our characters.</resource>
  <resource id="71.458">What they like to eat, what music they like, etc. And I don't!!</resource>
  <resource id="71.459">I've realized that my little made up people are completely passive on everything.</resource>
  <resource id="71.460">Sigh.</resource>
  <resource id="71.461">Well, I know that a lot of my LJ friends are writers, too.</resource>
  <resource id="71.462">I can tell.</resource>

  <resource id="73.506">So, ok, this happened like week before last, but I thought it was funny enough to mention today.</resource>
  <resource id="73.507">So Brandon and I were chilling out one night at home, after being out all night, and we decided to step out on the patio for a quick smoke.</resource>
  <resource id="73.508">Well, the new dog; Louis, went running out onto the patio and barking up a storm, as I stuck my head out, there sat this stupid young dude trying to break into my neighbor's (across the street) car.</resource>
  <resource id="73.509">So I called the cops and followed him till he went into the dark, then I left it to the cops.</resource>
  <resource id="73.510">911 operator asked "Is it a white guy or a latin guy".</resource>
  <resource id="73.511">so I gave her the real description; a young black male with short dreads and dark clothes and shoes.</resource>
  <resource id="73.512">One cop came, he talked to me for two seconds and then drove down the street a second.</resource>
  <resource id="73.513">So the next night, yes I said NEXT night, same scenario; we'd just gotten home dog runs on the patio, barks, I stick my head out and there sits the SAME DAMNED KID breaking into yet ANOTHER neighbors car.</resource>
  <resource id="73.514">This time, unfortunately, he'd broken INTO the car already and was fishing things out.</resource>
  <resource id="73.515">I pick up my phone ON THE BALCONY and call the cops wihle I'm walking behind this joker.</resource>
  <resource id="73.516">The cops come outta nowhere this time.</resource>
  <resource id="73.517">They sent SIX cop cars, two in each.</resource>
  <resource id="73.518">So 12 cops to investigate ONE car break in.</resource>
  <resource id="73.519">They all fly off in EVERY direction to find this kid (of course, except the direction I said he went).</resource>
  <resource id="73.520">So basically I've met three new neighbors and we have like a community watch going on now.</resource>
  <resource id="73.521">The cops spend more time driving down my road then they probably should.</resource>
  <resource id="73.522">But now I feel much happier and safer, and the neighbors all love me.  Did I mention it was after 2am every time the break-in occurred?</resource>
  <resource id="73.523">They still love me, even though I woke them up at the butt-crack of dawn.</resource>
  <resource id="73.524">It's a beautiful thing.</resource>
  <resource id="73.525">=o)  Although I feel like I've been on a really bad episode of 'Law &amp; Order' now.</resource>

  <resource id="74.526">There are moments in our lives when we find ourselves at a crossroad.</resource>
  <resource id="74.527">Afraid, confused, without a road map.</resource>
  <resource id="74.528">The choices we make in these moments can define the rest of our days.</resource>
  <resource id="74.529">Of course, when faced with the unknown many of us would turn around and run back.</resource>
  <resource id="74.530">But once in a while, people push on.</resource>
  <resource id="74.531">Into something better.</resource>
  <resource id="74.532">Something just beyond the pain of going on alone and just beyond the bravery and courage it takes to let someone in, or let them fade away.</resource>
  <resource id="74.533">Or to give someone a second chance.</resource>
  <resource id="74.534">Something beyond the quiet persistence of a dream.</resource>
  <resource id="74.535">Because it&apos;s only when you&apos;re tested that you truly discover who you are.</resource>
  <resource id="74.536">And it's only when you're tested that you discover who you can be.</resource>
  <resource id="74.537">The person you wanna be does exist on the other side of hard work, faith, and belief.</resource>

  <resource id="74.539">My worst fears have been personified.</resource>

  <resource id="74.541">No dates.</resource>
  <resource id="74.542">No times.</resource>
  <resource id="74.543">No nothing.</resource>
  <resource id="74.544">I only know that it could be anytime within the next 60 days.</resource>
  <resource id="74.545">I don't even know for sure that it will happen, but with the way things have been going, I expect it to happen.</resource>
  <resource id="74.546">I know that no matter what does or doesn't happen, God is going to take care of us because we have faith in him.</resource>
  <resource id="74.547">There's nothing else I can say or do to change the situation.</resource>
  <resource id="74.548">I can only trust in God to do what's best for us.</resource>
  <resource id="74.549">Trust in God not just when things are going wrong, but when they go right, because He is responsible for both the good and the bad.</resource>
  <resource id="74.550">If your faith can carry you through the bad, then life will be greater when you carry faith through the good.</resource>

  <resource id="77.610">Wow, I sure feel like an idiot.</resource>
  <resource id="77.611">Have you ever made a decision and then later found out the consequences to that decision?</resource>
  <resource id="77.612">Well, I seem to have done that.</resource>
  <resource id="77.613">I didn't mean to hurt this person at all.</resource>
  <resource id="77.614">I was just scared.</resource>
  <resource id="77.615">I mean.</resource>
  <resource id="77.616">I'm scared of my future.</resource>
  <resource id="77.617">I look ahead and I want to see me being a successful missionary/psychologist, married, with kids, and a great life.</resource>
  <resource id="77.618">However, it seems the decisions I have been making are hindering that.</resource>
  <resource id="77.619">I know I'm not making sense to anyone,but I have to write this down or i'll go crazy.</resource>
  <resource id="77.620">I look around me and you know what I see?</resource>
  <resource id="77.621">Un-happy people.</resource>
  <resource id="77.622">People everday get divorces, commit adultery and I don't want that.</resource>
  <resource id="77.623">I don't want to get hurt.</resource>
  <resource id="77.624">*sighs*  I have a bad habit of hurting people before they can hurt me.  Like if I think that someone could and might hurt me then I hurt them first.</resource>
  <resource id="77.625">I sound like a terrible person right?</resource>
  <resource id="77.626">I just can't help it.</resource>
  <resource id="77.627">Then I think if I commit myself to this person only, what if I'm missing out on someone else?</resource>
  <resource id="77.628">What if this isn't the right person for me and I'm making a huge mistake?</resource>
  <resource id="77.629">But then I also think what if they are the right person?</resource>
  <resource id="77.630">Why is everything so confusing to me?   I'm trying to hear God right now, but maybe I'm not really listening.</resource>
  <resource id="77.631">Everyone that's reading this probably thinks I'm crazy, but if I put down the person and thing I was talking about, it could hurt them.</resource>
  <resource id="77.632">Some people say, "Katrina, do this," others say, "Katrina, do that."</resource>
  <resource id="77.633">What do I say?</resource>
  <resource id="77.634">I DON'T KNOW!!!!!!!!!!</resource>
  <resource id="77.635">I'm in limbo world.</resource>
  <resource id="77.636">Sorry bout that lil post, it prolly sounds like I'm a crazy girl.</resource>
  <resource id="77.637">I guess i"m just gonna have to be patient.</resource>
  <resource id="77.638">I'll wait for God to show me what He wants me to do.</resource>
  <resource id="77.639">Faith is key.</resource>
  <resource id="77.640">So, keep praying for me that I'll be strong.</resource>
  <resource id="77.641">I just have these moments when I start trying to do things without God and that never works.</resource>

  <resource id="78.644">Welp today has been a long tiring day lol.</resource>
  <resource id="78.645">I have been up most the night because the baby wouldn't go to sleep for nothing.</resource>
  <resource id="78.646">We lay him on our chest and he zonks out pretty fast and now hes so used to it he won't sleep in his crib or basinet so we have to find a way for him to sleep in the crib.</resource>
  <resource id="78.647">Doctor says not to let them sleep on there belly for a while and thats the only way he sleeps good!</resource>
  <resource id="78.648">lol.</resource>

  <resource id="78.651">lol.</resource>
  <resource id="78.652">He sleeps most of the day and then never sleeps at night.</resource>
  <resource id="78.653">I can't make him stay up lol.</resource>
  <resource id="78.654">Oh well I know its something that comes along with having a baby lol.</resource>
  <resource id="78.655">I will be glad when my mom gets here so we can go to wal-mart and then I can come back home and take a little nap.</resource>
  <resource id="78.656">I feel so sorry for David lol he stayed up with him and let me get a couple of hours of sleep last night but thats about it and then he got no sleep and is at work now lol.</resource>
  <resource id="78.657">Anyways,tomorrow I guess my grandpa wants us to come over there so his brother than is in town to visit and everyone can see the baby.</resource>
  <resource id="78.658">I am not to thrilled about going over there.</resource>
  <resource id="78.659">But he may have some baby stuff for me lol so I am just going to deal with it and then after we leave there David and I are going to go to Six Flags,we may take my brother and sister and there friends not sure.</resource>
  <resource id="78.660">I don't think I can even ride anything yet,I still feel like crap lol but today is Davids 21st birthday (Woo Hoo!)</resource>
  <resource id="78.661">lol,and so we figgured we would just go to Six Flags.</resource>
  <resource id="78.662">We could go out and I could watch him drink but he got a ticket and they have to mail his license to him and he has no ID yet!</resource>
  <resource id="78.663">HAHA!</resource>
  <resource id="78.664">(Jerk!</resource>

  <resource id="79.673">Almost sounds like an EMO song title.</resource>
  <resource id="79.674">Maybe it is, I dunno.</resource>
  <resource id="79.675">All I know is that I have no time to do anything anymore.</resource>
  <resource id="79.676">I am once again becoming an OT whore, which was originally to buy myself a new gun (Springfiled XD40 3" Subcompact).</resource>
  <resource id="79.677">But, with pay days in Oct. being where they are, and bills due on the dates they're due, that idea is totally shot for now.</resource>
  <resource id="79.678">The OT whoring now is to make enough to pay bills on time, not to buy new and fun things.</resource>
  <resource id="79.679">At least the price of gas is going down, $1.99 per gallon across the street now.</resource>
  <resource id="79.680">I'm also working at the YMCA every Monday in October, which helps, but makes me tired as all get out.</resource>
  <resource id="79.681">The job is still just that.</resource>
  <resource id="79.682">Nothing big to report, except that every time I volunteer to do a full 8 hours of OT after my normal shift, I find myself going home 2-4 hours into it due to them over-hiring and not realizing it.</resource>
  <resource id="79.683">It's good cuz I get time, it sux because I really need the money, bad, now!</resource>
  <resource id="79.684">I even begged and pleaded with the LT. to let me stay and do some "busy work" for the rest of the 8 hours today.</resource>
  <resource id="79.685">I have a new pic of Melissa and I, which I will post shortly.</resource>
  <resource id="79.686">We need a new pic.</resource>
  <resource id="79.687">We just celebrated 3 great months on the 8th, and last night we carved pumpkins (she brought me a pumpkin, it was pretty sweet).</resource>
  <resource id="79.688">I just wish I had more time to see her.</resource>
  <resource id="79.689">Bagpiping got moved to one of our "together" nights, so that puts a small damper on the time we see each other for every week.</resource>
  <resource id="79.690">Oh well, at least we can make it work without lots of time.</resource>
  <resource id="79.691">I joined a gun club the other night.</resource>
  <resource id="79.692">It's kinda far from where I am, but it is worth it.</resource>
  <resource id="79.693">Membership is only $50/year and a $50 initiation fee.</resource>
  <resource id="79.694">The shooting is unlimited for the most part between 8a and 10p.</resource>
  <resource id="79.695">This is good for the odd hour shooter like me. Also, there is a 25 yd outdoor range, which accepts a variety of loads (shotgun, magnum, etc).</resource>
  <resource id="79.696">The indoor range has 8 lanes, but is only 15 yards long.</resource>
  <resource id="79.697">The best part is, I shoot pretty well there, and the lighting is really good.</resource>
  <resource id="79.698">If anyone is interested, it's the Phillipsburg Pistol Club, and can be found on the web (just google it's name).</resource>
  <resource id="79.699">I'm gonna hit the work out now.</resource>
  <resource id="79.700">I'll write more later.</resource>

  <resource id="80.701">Reawaken is taking allot of my time this week inspite of my heavy harvest schedule on the farm!</resource>
  <resource id="80.702">We are starting to get some interesting inquiries.</resource>
  <resource id="80.703">I made contact with various Pentagon types who deal specifically with the USO and stand down concerts on a variety of military installations in California.</resource>
  <resource id="80.704">Also since I belong to a variety of social organizations it was easy to make concert contacts through them.</resource>
  <resource id="80.705">Who knows where we will be playing in 2007.</resource>
  <resource id="80.706">I have my eyes on a few locations like Kwajalein RMI and Soto Cano-Honduras; with friends in low places we'll probably get those gigs.</resource>
  <resource id="80.707">In the mean time we have a huge private party in April booked and the Mateel Arts and Music Festival for June as well.</resource>
  <resource id="80.708">The list of folks who want a copy of the CD-First Light is being built up one name at a time.</resource>
  <resource id="80.709">Anyone who wants one I will send one.</resource>
  <resource id="80.710">I gotta laugh with all the biker, leather folks I deal with regularly you would think it would be an easy task to get gigs for Reawaken!</resource>
  <resource id="80.711">I may just have the band members do a strip for old ladies at the senior clubs if we have open dates unfilled!</resource>
  <resource id="80.712">Ha!</resource>
  <resource id="80.713">Wouldn't that be a gig!?</resource>
  <resource id="80.714">In the mean time I am going after every venue available.</resource>
  <resource id="80.715">Leaving for Irvine on the 18th for Maiden.</resource>

  <resource id="81.721">The streets are insanity, cops are running around with horses wrangling boys who call the horses 'Buttercup.'</resource>
  <resource id="81.722">I was cleaning up Kristen Ward's apartment when a beer spilled all over my socks and pants and I don't even care.</resource>
  <resource id="81.723">Like thousands of people poured into the street last night for excitement.</resource>
  <resource id="81.724">Lots of people had sex.</resource>
  <resource id="81.725">Lots of people used drugs and drank beer.</resource>
  <resource id="81.726">Tonight is the Michigan vs. PSU game.</resource>
  <resource id="81.727">Tonight is also the drag show which I shall be attending faithfully.</resource>

  <resource id="81.729">Wow.</resource>
  <resource id="81.730">I'm reading this back to myself and I'm totally yawning.</resource>
  <resource id="81.731">Last night I had a long discussion at 4:30am about xanax addiction and molestation.</resource>
  <resource id="81.732">It was weird.</resource>
  <resource id="81.733">I played therapist and it was bizarre.</resource>
  <resource id="81.734">People actually listened to me.  I wasn't that bumbling idiot rubbing my fat man hooters together during a performance of "Buttons."</resource>
  <resource id="81.735">Oh my god I'm a hag!</resource>
  <resource id="81.736">Let's face it.</resource>
  <resource id="81.737">I don't drink anymore.</resource>
  <resource id="81.738">I had three beers last night and felt oh so silly.</resource>
  <resource id="81.739">Hard alcohol would surely have put me in the ER.</resource>
  <resource id="81.740">And this hair.</resource>
  <resource id="81.741">Lex Squared told me that she could "do something" with my hair.</resource>
  <resource id="81.742">That's a polite way of saying.</resource>
  <resource id="81.743">your hair looks like shit Mary.</resource>
  <resource id="81.744">Fix that!</resource>
  <resource id="81.745">I'm staying with Kristen Ward.</resource>
  <resource id="81.746">She has 4 boys staying her who attend West Point.</resource>
  <resource id="81.747">Hi.</resource>
  <resource id="81.748">They're cute.</resource>
  <resource id="81.749">But I'm on fire.</resource>
  <resource id="81.750">Like flame isn't the word, I'm homo extremous.</resource>
  <resource id="81.751">So I toned down the performance and slept until right now.</resource>
  <resource id="81.752">Everyone is gone and I just cleaned up, so now I'm going to loosen up my buttons, take a long hot shower, put on my clothing and my adorable pea coat, and make my way downtown.</resource>
  <resource id="81.753">Let's just hope some rowdy frat boy doesn't toss his beer bottle at me like last year.</resource>
  <resource id="81.754">Disaster.</resource>
  <resource id="81.755">I almost died.</resource>
  <resource id="81.756">Thank god I was two degrees south of his violent transgression.</resource>
  <resource id="81.757">Dead right.</resource>
  <resource id="81.758">And I still rule this town, I'm just a little more mature, a little more with it.</resource>
  <resource id="81.759">Look at me!  I'm like Ellen on straight television.</resource>
  <resource id="81.760">I'm a maneater!</resource>

  <resource id="82.765">The other week I was at Roxy with Robbie and company and the crack house came up.</resource>
  <resource id="82.766">The puzzled expression on the face of one Robbies friend, and the consequent demanding of an explination reminded me that I really need to write some of that shit down while its still somewhat fresh.</resource>
  <resource id="82.767">But so much of the craziness there just became common place to me and I have trouble thinking about what stands out for individual stories.</resource>
  <resource id="82.768">I suppose there was the time that Dread, named not for the feeling one gets when thinking about the smell which followed him, but rather for his haircut, came by while my mother was there and pulled bacon out of his pocket, and then his other pocket, and then from under his shirt, then from his pants.</resource>
  <resource id="82.769">"How much you give me for this Bacon?"</resource>
  <resource id="82.770">I don't know, I'm not feeling it.</resource>
  <resource id="82.771">nevermind, I've got an Arabic test I could be studying for.</resource>

  <resource id="83.774">I discovered Ebay.</resource>
  <resource id="83.775">Within a week I bid on and won about 14 cookie jars.</resource>
  <resource id="83.776">They are just so cute I can't resist them although I think I am under control now.</resource>
  <resource id="83.777">At least I haven't bought any in about four days.</resource>
  <resource id="83.778">I still have six that have not arrived yet.</resource>
  <resource id="83.779">The lady at the post office is starting to laugh at me.  Where am I going to put them all?</resource>
  <resource id="83.780">Oh well, I will find space or have Tim build me some shelves.</resource>
  <resource id="83.781">I have only had one bad experience on Ebay so far.</resource>
  <resource id="83.782">One cookie jar was not packed well.</resource>
  <resource id="83.783">It was called "Ugly Old Hen".</resource>
  <resource id="83.784">It was broken.</resource>
  <resource id="83.785">I emailed the seller and told him about it and he was very arrogant and rude.</resource>
  <resource id="83.786">HE KNEW EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO KNOW ABOUT PACKING, he said.</resource>
  <resource id="83.787">Well, needless to say his packing job was far below any I have seen so far.</resource>
  <resource id="83.788">To make a long story short, he told me I must have wanted this ugly old hen to match my personality.</resource>
  <resource id="83.789">I told him he was a f----ing a--hole and gave him a negative rating.</resource>
  <resource id="83.790">He in turn gave me a negative rating.</resource>
  <resource id="83.791">Man.  I just can't seem to keep out of trouble.</resource>
  <resource id="83.792">It really was his fault though.</resource>
  <resource id="83.793">And because I am such a perfectionist the negative rating had me bummed for awhile but now I am better.</resource>
  <resource id="83.794">I even sold a few things on Ebay.</resource>
  <resource id="83.795">I sold an electric blanket for more than I paid for it.</resource>
  <resource id="83.796">I see Frankie at the junkyard has several electric blankets.</resource>
  <resource id="83.797">I can probably pick them up for less than a buck and sell them for lots lots more as long as they work.</resource>
  <resource id="83.798">Will have to work on that enterprise.</resource>
  <resource id="83.799">Tim and I have been fishing and camping.</resource>
  <resource id="83.800">We have been staying pretty close to home but still having a good time.</resource>
  <resource id="83.801">It has finally cooled down a bit which is a big relief.</resource>
  <resource id="83.802">There always seems to be much to do around here and we don't seem to get much done.</resource>
  <resource id="83.803">Or at least I don't.</resource>
  <resource id="83.804">I love my "nap and story time with BooBoo every afternoon."</resource>
  <resource id="83.805">That means I recline on the couch with a good book after lunch and BooBoo my cat is always stretched out on my lap.</resource>
  <resource id="83.806">Tim is working on putting a border fence up in the front of the property.</resource>
  <resource id="83.807">Then he wants to put in an underground sprinkler system before we plant grass in front.</resource>
  <resource id="83.808">We also will be planting trees and shrubs in front and some day putting a small deck coming out of the front door.</resource>
  <resource id="83.809">It just all takes time and money.</resource>
  <resource id="83.810">We have come a long way in a year though!</resource>
  <resource id="83.811">Well, must go put dinner in the oven.</resource>
  <resource id="83.812">Homemade macaroni and cheese.</resource>
  <resource id="83.813">Today I also made a devils food bundt cake with chocolate chip glaze.</resource>
  <resource id="83.814">With all this cheese we will probably be constipated tomorrow.</resource>

  <resource id="84.819">Thursday:</resource>
  <resource id="84.820">I came home and I think I took a nap,</resource>
  <resource id="84.821">Then later hung out with some loser until like 12.</resource>
  <resource id="84.822">Friday:</resource>
  <resource id="84.823">Chels and I cleaned my room, which was much needed.</resource>
  <resource id="84.824">Then Ashlie and Becky came and picked me up, we stopped at Joey's to see if they had any applications, then went out to the mall so I could turn in some apps, and so Ashlie could buy some underwears.</resource>
  <resource id="84.825">I came home and got my stuff together to go up to the kid's camp.</resource>
  <resource id="84.826">And gosh, I swear, Last night, had to be one of the worst night's of my entire life.</resource>
  <resource id="84.827">First off, it's a hike to get up to this place, and I can't see worth shit in the dark.</resource>
  <resource id="84.828">We were up there for awhile and Idk why or how, but Ryan pushed me off of this bench and I fell flat on my back scraping my hip up, which hurts ha.</resource>
  <resource id="84.829">Then they were cutting this damn tree down, and they made me go with then by dragging me over since I didn't want to go, and when I tried to sneak away.</resource>
  <resource id="84.830">I guess I walked behind Ryan right when he swung this huge ass AXE and he swung it right into my face!</resource>
  <resource id="84.831">God I swear I thought I got hit with like a brick.</resource>
  <resource id="84.832">Luckily, it wasnt the metal part, or I might be dead right now, but my face is swolen and cut up, you can kinda tell in the picture my one cheek is a lot bigger than the other.</resource>
  <resource id="84.833">Not only all that, I ended up calling Aubrey, and ending up balling like a baby, because I really do miss her and everything we used to have.</resource>
  <resource id="84.834">Even after getting off the phone with her, I balled forever.</resource>
  <resource id="84.835">It was sooo cold out, seeing as I don't have a winter jacket or anything.</resource>
  <resource id="84.836">Plus, I didn't eat anything at all yesterday, and I ended up getting really sick.</resource>
  <resource id="84.837">It was real lame.</resource>
  <resource id="84.838">Ehh Other than that it was a good time.</resource>
  <resource id="84.839">Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting</resource>
  <resource id="84.840">Today, Chels made me a sandwhich since she loves me, and I had some soup so I feel better.</resource>

  <resource id="85.845">It all started a month ago in kickboxing class (at least that part sounds way cool.)</resource>
  <resource id="85.846">The new instructor is a former marine and showed us these five-pointed-star push-ups.</resource>
  <resource id="85.847">I thought, "I'm not going to look like the only pussy in class, I can do these!"</resource>
  <resource id="85.848">Yeah, I know, right up there with Custer laughing off a few measly Indians.</resource>
  <resource id="85.849">Anyway, I get home and notice my knee feels kinda tight.</resource>

  <resource id="85.851">Okay, no problem, I'll just tone down my workouts until I'm back at 100%.</resource>
  <resource id="85.852">But after a month, that hasn't really happened.</resource>
  <resource id="85.853">So I figure I'll just check in with my G.P., get a nice cortisone shot in the knee and I'm good to go.</resource>
  <resource id="85.854">But my beloved G.P., who usually just prescribes stuff for me over the phone, starts throwing around words like "orthopedic," "surgery," and "x-rays" and I start thinking, "oh shit!"</resource>
  <resource id="85.855">My orthopedic doctor is a hot, young thing who looks like The Rock, but talks at fast as the Isuzu guy in those old, used car commercials.</resource>
  <resource id="85.856">Of course once he says the magic words ("degenerative arthritis" and "not uncommon AT MY AGE") I do a total brain freeze and hear pretty much nothing afterwards.</resource>
  <resource id="85.857">All I have at this point is a $73.00 knee brace and a month's worth of appointments for physical therapy--that part sounds sexy, but I'm guessing it's totally not.</resource>
  <resource id="85.858">So what's a girl to do to cheer herself up?</resource>
  <resource id="85.859">Shoe shopping, of course!</resource>
  <resource id="85.860">So I'm old, but I have these really cute Etienne Aigner boots to show for it.</resource>
  <resource id="85.861">My gene pool used to lie before me like a pretty lake and I rarely gave it much thought.</resource>
  <resource id="85.862">Now I see the tsunami of malidies looming before me and I'm scrambling on the beach looking for a fucking tree!</resource>
  <resource id="85.863">Well, you know what?</resource>
  <resource id="85.864">I'm not going to grow old gracefully!</resource>
  <resource id="85.865">I'm never wearing fucking purple, and I'm going to be one of those cranky, old bitches with a pointy cane who knows how to use it!</resource>
  <resource id="85.866">I guess it's a good thing that according to deathclock.com I've only got another 17 years to worry about it!</resource>

  <resource id="86.867">In the last fifteen years,</resource>
  <resource id="86.868">my life has been somewhat conventional:</resource>
  <resource id="86.869">job, wife, two kids, house, car.</resource>
  <resource id="86.870">Seen from a distance, I've been following the script,</resource>
  <resource id="86.871">the path that society lays down for people like me.</resource>

  <resource id="86.874">the times we have been at our best, have shone brightest,</resource>
  <resource id="86.875">have been when we have turned the script upside-down;</resource>
  <resource id="86.876">skipped a line or a page or an act;</resource>
  <resource id="86.877">swapped parts;</resource>
  <resource id="86.878">read sections backwards;</resource>
  <resource id="86.879">cut pages up and rearranged them;</resource>
  <resource id="86.880">or just set fire to the whole thing and made it up as we've gone along.</resource>
  <resource id="86.881">Even now, here at the end of this act, when our melodrama seems to have turned to tragedy, the best days, the brightest moments, the truest lines and words and letters, come when we say, to ourselves or each other: "Screw the damn script!</resource>

<block id="block 107">
  <resource id="107.87">I saw Phil.</resource>
  <resource id="107.88">I went to Sheldon's house.</resource>
  <resource id="107.89">We sat outside on his porch.</resource>
  <resource id="107.90">Sheldon, Phil, Daniel, and I.</resource>
  <resource id="107.91">Phil of course, was acting stupid.</resource>
  <resource id="107.92">Talking about running into ongoing traffic and killing himself, and doing weed.</resource>
  <resource id="107.93">Sheldon and I told him to shut up.</resource>
  <resource id="107.94">He got up and said he doesn't have to take this from us and was especially angry at me. I was a mega bitch to him.</resource>
  <resource id="107.95">I tried to control myself.</resource>
  <resource id="107.96">He was so good-looking.</resource>
  <resource id="107.97">His hair, his eyes, his dimples.</resource>
  <resource id="107.98">He has a new eye brow piercing.</resource>
  <resource id="107.99">It suits him.</resource>
  <resource id="107.100">Unlike this unfitting addiction he has.</resource>
  <resource id="107.101">Sheldon wanted my going there to be awkward for Phil and I. I would friendly tease Phil, and he'd say "Well Jordan, you're mostly dissing yourself, you dated him".</resource>
  <resource id="107.102">Words like that made me and Phil stop smiling, look straight at Sheldon, and say "shut up" at the same time.</resource>
  <resource id="107.103">It's still too soon to make those comments.</resource>
  <resource id="107.104">Hell, NEVER make them.</resource>
  <resource id="107.105">But he did.</resource>
  <resource id="107.106">Because he knew I needed the reaction.</resource>
  <resource id="107.107">A couple of times Sheldon would say things to him and he would get angry and tell him to shut up.</resource>
  <resource id="107.108">I asked them to go to the store with me. Sheldon said no because he looked horrible.</resource>
  <resource id="107.109">And really, he kind of did.</resource>
  <resource id="107.110">haha.</resource>
  <resource id="107.111">I let him slip.</resource>
  <resource id="107.112">Phil reluctantly came along.</resource>
  <resource id="107.113">He didn't want to make eye contact with me, but we made eye contact a lot.</resource>
  <resource id="107.114">It was brief, and every single time, we would smile.</resource>
  <resource id="107.115">Like a personal moment.</resource>
  <resource id="107.116">But I didn't hug him.</resource>
  <resource id="107.117">And I didn't try to touch him.</resource>
  <resource id="107.118">I didn't want to make physicaly contact.</resource>
  <resource id="107.119">The verbal contact and the presence was good enough.</resource>
  <resource id="107.120">The whole way there he was grabbing onto poles and screaming like a banshee and his friend Johnny (who came along) got a swift punch in the nuts from Phil.</resource>
  <resource id="107.121">I asked Phil, "what the hell are you doing?" and he looked angrily at me. Like I did anything wrong.</resource>
  <resource id="107.122">Was I wrong to be taken aback by that?!</resource>
  <resource id="107.123">No.</resource>
  <resource id="107.124">Then when we were there, I got what I needed, as did they, and I was standing outside with Phil as the other two were still in there.</resource>
  <resource id="107.125">I started talking to him about why he was so mad, and he said "you called me retarded", and I explained that he was being a prick.</resource>
  <resource id="107.126">And he said that since he started drugs, he's a prick.</resource>
  <resource id="107.127">And that it's him now.</resource>
  <resource id="107.128">I told him that's not true.</resource>
  <resource id="107.129">He "whatever"ed me. UGH.</resource>
  <resource id="107.130">Then I said, "Phil, why are you being so mean?" and he said he doesn't care about anybody anymore, because he lost friends due to drugs.</resource>
  <resource id="107.131">I told him he didn't lose me, and he just looked at me and didn't say a word.</resource>
  <resource id="107.132">I assured him, "you do care.</resource>
  <resource id="107.133">You just don't show it anymore."</resource>
  <resource id="107.134">and by then, they guys were out of the store.</resource>
  <resource id="107.135">Phil walked away quickly.</resource>
  <resource id="107.136">They followed, but Daniel took two minutes to look back at me. I was angry.</resource>
  <resource id="107.137">My facial expression was beyond hurt.</resource>
  <resource id="107.138">"Are you okay?", He asked.</resource>
  <resource id="107.139">"Yeah, I'm going to go home."</resource>
  <resource id="107.140">"You're not coming with us?"</resource>
  <resource id="107.141">"No, I'm going to go."</resource>
  <resource id="107.142">"Why?"</resource>
  <resource id="107.143">"Is it really that hard to tell?"</resource>
  <resource id="107.144">I know I shouldn't have been snotty about it but I thought it was fucking obvious.</resource>
  <resource id="107.145">I was so desperate to go home I couldn't stand being there anymore.</resource>
  <resource id="107.146">I called home to as my mom for a ride but she said she was busy, I WAS NEAR CRYING AND SHE WAS "BUSY"?</resource>
  <resource id="107.147">I hung up and started walking home.</resource>
  <resource id="107.148">Like 10 minutes into walking home aaron pulled up to drive me home.</resource>
  <resource id="107.149">I dont know if mom told him I needed a ride, but he saved me from a break down.</resource>
  <resource id="107.150">He's such a crazy idiot sometimes but hes really caring when he knows somethings wrong.</resource>
  <resource id="107.151">We hung out in his car for the rest of the day talking and laughing.</resource>
  <resource id="107.152">I never even told him what happened, but he helped, a lot.</resource>

  <resource id="112.219">When your Trainer comes into the room all smiles after lunch and announces that she moved up ONE level- (From ABT Trainer 1 to ABT Trainer 2) and got a $10,000 salary increase.</resource>
  <resource id="112.220">yeah- I'm not going anywhere.</resource>
  <resource id="112.221">Think I'll stay at AFLAC.</resource>
  <resource id="112.222">It makes me sick that my trainer is 24.</resource>
  <resource id="112.223">started in the call center- and is making mad money.</resource>
  <resource id="112.224">That means if I stay on the right path- when I'm 25 I could be an ABT Trainer 2 as well- or the equivalent.</resource>
  <resource id="112.225">I could be an IT Specialist V in 4 years.</resource>
  <resource id="112.226">I could be Paul Amos Jr's secretary- if I work hard enough.</resource>
  <resource id="112.227">The advancement opportunities are just awesome.</resource>
  <resource id="112.228">The sole stipulation: Do your time first.</resource>
  <resource id="112.229">Spend 1 year answering calls for the Claims spread- and then be free to go to where-ever your heart desires.</resource>
  <resource id="112.230">Don't like it?</resource>
  <resource id="112.231">Just move somewhere else!</resource>
  <resource id="112.232">Speaking of the famous Amos' -( not the cookie people, ;) - the AFLAC founders)- I passed Dan Amos in the hallway yesterday.</resource>
  <resource id="112.233">THE BIG DOG.</resource>
  <resource id="112.234">THE NUMERO UNO in the company.</resource>
  <resource id="112.235">And then I just think about that song from Office Space-- "Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta." lol.</resource>
  <resource id="112.236">Don't get me wrong- we all make mad money at AFLAC-- but the millionaires- they started on the same page we're starting on now.</resource>
  <resource id="112.237">I want that.</resource>
  <resource id="112.238">I've realized what I want in life.</resource>
  <resource id="112.239">I want a family.</resource>
  <resource id="112.240">BADLY.</resource>
  <resource id="112.241">(Not bad enough to go get knocked up, I would never do that just to have a baby-- but I want to be a mom.)</resource>
  <resource id="112.242">I've been staying at Mary's house and she keeps telling me I'd be an awesome mommy.</resource>
  <resource id="112.243">She told me 4 times yesterday.</resource>
  <resource id="112.244">Yeah- I really would.</resource>
  <resource id="112.245">I want to have kids- a nice car, a nice house, and AFLAC.</resource>
  <resource id="112.246">I see everyday just how much good that company does.</resource>
  <resource id="112.247">It takes your breath away.</resource>
  <resource id="112.248">They raised over $200,000.00 for Cancer Research with a BASEBALL GAME!</resource>
  <resource id="112.249">(The AFLAC All-American Baseball Classic).</resource>
  <resource id="112.250">I monitored calls today with Julia.</resource>
  <resource id="112.251">Her care and patience with the policyholders was astounding.</resource>
  <resource id="112.252">People would call in and say they'd had amputations, and deaths in their families, and paralysis- and she would handle the calls with a clever mix of empathy, professionalism, and care.</resource>
  <resource id="112.253">She never once had a caller that she didn't make laugh- at least once during their call.</resource>
  <resource id="112.254">That old quote comes back to me- the origin has slipped my mind, but "we are the movers and the shakers and the dreamers of dreams."</resource>
  <resource id="112.255">I have the world in the palm of my hands.</resource>
  <resource id="112.256">The corporate world at least.</resource>
  <resource id="112.257">I'm still working on that family part.</resource>
  <resource id="112.258">But I guess it's like that quote from What Dreams May Come -- "Sometimes when you win, you lose."</resource>
  <resource id="112.259">I won my place in Corporate America.</resource>
  <resource id="112.260">but I've not talked to the most important person in my life- in over a week.</resource>
  <resource id="112.261">and it's killing me.</resource>
  <resource id="112.262">I'm starting to fray at the ends- the next step is to break- somethings gotta give and I'm pulling with all my might to keep everything together.</resource>
  <resource id="112.263">But even superman has his kryptonite.</resource>
  <resource id="112.264">I don't know what to do.</resource>
  <resource id="112.265">I'm tired of broken promises- and empty dreams.</resource>
  <resource id="112.266">I'm tired of wishing and longing and hoping for something that isn't happening- and hasn't been happening.</resource>
  <resource id="112.267">Or he would've come through last weekend.</resource>
  <resource id="112.268">The thread to this relationship is wearing thin- it's on it's last strand- and though he may think it's cool to not do what he says hes going to- it's not cool to me.</resource>
  <resource id="112.269">The worst part is- I love him.</resource>
  <resource id="112.270">I love him with every ounce of everything that I am- but try as I might- we just cant' get it together.</resource>
  <resource id="112.271">Sometimes I feel as if I'm talking to myself.</resource>
  <resource id="112.272">I just wanted you to be honest with me and love me.  damn, is that too much to ask?</resource>
  <resource id="112.273">It's not over.</resource>
  <resource id="112.274">We're still together- and we still have the opportunity to make things right - - - but I'm a very patient person- and it's been close to 5 years now- and my patience is wearing thin.</resource>
  <resource id="112.275">Something has to happen SOON.</resource>
  <resource id="112.276">I would like to be married before I'm 23.</resource>

<block id="block 113">
  <resource id="113.277">Yes, we are having a small celebration today.</resource>
  <resource id="113.278">Wayne just called me!!!!!!!!</resource>
  <resource id="113.279">I am always so happy after talking to him!</resource>
  <resource id="113.280">Anyway, he said that since he (and all of the troop) are having to stay 16 months, they are getting to come home for 5 whole days for leave after they are done with their training (and before they go to thier permanent post).</resource>
  <resource id="113.281">Apparently, it was not Wayne alone who was misled.</resource>
  <resource id="113.282">The rest of the troop that he was sent with thought they were only going for 12 months.</resource>
  <resource id="113.283">So they thought they were going for 12 and Wayne thought he was going for 10 and then one day BOOM they are staying for 16.</resource>
  <resource id="113.284">And every sigle one of them are furious.</resource>
  <resource id="113.285">Wayne says that the tension is unreal.</resource>
  <resource id="113.286">So they are getting to come home for a short time after thier training.</resource>
  <resource id="113.287">Now, they don't know yet when that will be, but I don't care.</resource>
  <resource id="113.288">I will get that 5 days and then later on he will still get RnR.</resource>
  <resource id="113.289">That was the first thing that I thought "will that cut down yalls RnR?" and he said no.</resource>
  <resource id="113.290">It is just something they get to do because they are having to go longer than intended or however they word that!</resource>
  <resource id="113.291">In other news (as if anything could be better, besides Wayne not going!)</resource>
  <resource id="113.292">Alley still hasn't had those pups.</resource>
  <resource id="113.293">I told her that she better get on the ball and she looked at me and yawned so maybe that was a yes, lol.</resource>
  <resource id="113.294">I hope that she has them tonight.</resource>
  <resource id="113.295">If not I may have to get her a shot to induce labor.</resource>
  <resource id="113.296">It has been 4 days since her milk dropped and they are supposed to have the pups after 5.</resource>
  <resource id="113.297">We'll see.</resource>
  <resource id="113.298">That was one of the first things that Wayne wanted to know "hows alley, has she had the pups" I think he loves those dogs as much as me! I'll never forget the first tail that he docked by himself (it was Tuff's tail).</resource>
  <resource id="113.299">He kept wanting me to let him do it but I was nervous (I admit that) but he did a good job.</resource>
  <resource id="113.300">I was so proud.</resource>
  <resource id="113.301">Keep in mind that we had only just moved in together at that time and he didn't know much about whelping pups!</resource>
  <resource id="113.302">He had watched me dock two litters but still he did a great job.</resource>
  <resource id="113.303">Now, he wishes that he was here to help with this litter Image.</resource>
  <resource id="113.304">But I am still SOOOOO excited that I'll get to see him for 5 days!!!!!!!!</resource>
  <resource id="113.305">As far as school goes.</resource>
  <resource id="113.306">I start my very last class Monday.</resource>
  <resource id="113.307">It is yet another Accounting class so everyone wish me luck!</resource>
  <resource id="113.308">Love, Hugs, and God Bless</resource>

  <resource id="118.461">Our conversations with family, friends, co-workers etc., all seem to revolve around how crappy are day is, has been, or is going to be, and it seems all like we compete with one another to see who has a crappier one.</resource>

  <resource id="118.470">I have to look at life in her perspective, and it would break anyones heart.</resource>
  <resource id="118.471">To have something inside of you that you cannot control, something foreign that has stolen away your chance of a normal life.</resource>
  <resource id="118.472">Not being able to tell if what you are seeing is real or a  hallucination, hearing things that are not there, not real.</resource>
  <resource id="118.473">being alienated, being alone.</resource>
  <resource id="118.474">because everyone you come to know eventually pushes you away because that cannot cope, or understand you, or love you and accept you, and stand by you through moments in time.</resource>
  <resource id="118.475">I have come to see that I have always loved her, I never hated her.</resource>
  <resource id="118.476">I can only take so much of her though, for her sake and mine :).</resource>
  <resource id="118.477">I have a job where I have come to know some amazing people who have such potential, but possibly will never get to put it to any use due to the cirumstances of the choices in life.</resource>
  <resource id="118.478">but they make my time at work memorable.</resource>
  <resource id="118.479">I will be sad to go, but happy to move on to something new and challenging.</resource>

  <resource id="118.481">one I am not thinking long term.</resource>
  <resource id="118.482">the future is not something I bother with.</resource>
  <resource id="118.483">I have put my life in the hands of god, and left him to it.</resource>

  <resource id="118.486">maybe more so.</resource>
  <resource id="118.487">Despite all that I have come to learn and accept in myself, I will always be stubborn to  the fact of wanting others to be happy, and sacrificing my own happiness for it.</resource>
  <resource id="118.488">I am stubborn in that what I think I believe may not be true.</resource>
  <resource id="118.489">I still am negative towards myself and that is why I have pretty much alientated everyone from my past out of my life.</resource>
  <resource id="118.490">I needed to start over new.</resource>
  <resource id="118.491">there where to many memories that were putting me on the edge.</resource>

<block id="block 119">
  <resource id="119.500">A few days ago, I ran into this article online: http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14126192/ talking about statistics regarding the number of friends people having being at some sort of new low.</resource>
  <resource id="119.501">Not long afterwards, I had a conversation with Colin that crossed some of the same subject on a more personal basis, and it's had me thinking a lot about friends and friendships and my experiences with both.</resource>
  <resource id="119.502">I guess I fit the group the article refers to, in regards to having only 2 or 3 friends that would fall into the "support mechanism" category, if only because of circumstantial or geographical factors being taken into consideration as well.</resource>
  <resource id="119.503">One of those 3 will be moving this fall, and the others have an awful lot going on in their lives, in addition to being less available than the first by a long shot anyhow.</resource>
  <resource id="119.504">Realistically, when friend number one exits the scene, my options for anything passing for routine entertainment or companionship pretty much vanish until I can cultivate new ones.</resource>
  <resource id="119.505">It's both a frightening and interesting prospect.</resource>
  <resource id="119.506">On a larger scale, this really makes me think about the way that I've cultivated my friendships, and the way I've maintained them as well.</resource>
  <resource id="119.507">I definitely feel like, moreso than any other time in my life, I'm operating almost at the ground floor in regards to the friendships I have and the way I interact with those friends.</resource>
  <resource id="119.508">I've burned a lot of bridges and engaged in decisions which have hampered my ability to be trusted as much as I'd like to be by some of my friends, and likewise, there have been things which have altered my ability to fully engage some people as well, be they circumstacial or environmental or whatever.</resource>
  <resource id="119.509">I'm not going to name names or point the finger, as this is much more a reflection of myself than any sort of statement or accusation of anyone or any event.</resource>
  <resource id="119.510">Suffice to say that there are a fair amount of people out there whom I would count among my friends, but limited few whom I would count as good friends, due to actions both inside and outside of my role in that friendship.</resource>
  <resource id="119.511">A lot of it is just the simple matter of neglect, the missed opportunities, unreturned calls, and shifting of priorities that causes a full-time friendship to fall into part-time status.</resource>
  <resource id="119.512">We're getting older, we have a lot more work-related matters and our personal lives can get pretty complicated.</resource>
  <resource id="119.513">You build friendships as fortifications against getting too old too fast, but sometimes life just catches up with you regardless of your efforts.</resource>
  <resource id="119.514">On a "big picture" scale, I'd like to believe that I still hold the same value system that I held when I was 18 years old, now a scary half-a-lifetime ago.</resource>
  <resource id="119.515">If I broke things down on a value-by-value basis, I'd immediately begin to see the compromises, both self-imposed and accidentally stumbled-upon, and it paints a more honest picture of a lifetime of expectations tempered by both the hand of fate and the workings of both moments of incredible strength and incredible weakness.</resource>
  <resource id="119.516">All in all, I'm satisfied with the bigger picture and angry as fuck at the smaller details, but that's what keeps you going, isn't it?</resource>
  <resource id="119.517">If I didn't have the desire to be better than what I currently am, would I have impetus to keep living at all?</resource>
  <resource id="119.518">I hope not.</resource>
  <resource id="119.519">As far as "support mechanisms" go, I've seen what they do to people- at their best, they act as a bridge to help people reach things both within and outside themself that they may not have been previously able to reach.</resource>
  <resource id="119.520">And at their worst, they act as a crutch, keeping you mired in the same situations you've been trying to remove yourself from, were it not for the comfort and familiarity you've found yourself unwilling to potentially sacrifice to actually find yourself in a better place.</resource>
  <resource id="119.521">Home may be where you hang your hat, but happiness is sometimes found far from home or in the last place you'd even expect to look for it.</resource>
  <resource id="119.522">I think sometimes it can be easy to lose track of the idea that happiness and comfort are two completely separate entities and having one does not guarantee or equal having the other (some of the time, at least.</resource>
  <resource id="119.523">It goes back to that whole journey vs. destination idea, in that some people only mark success by arriving at a goal, while others are capable of enjoying the efforts required to reach that goal as well.</resource>
  <resource id="119.524">In the end, who is more satisfied- the person who suffers and bitches because things aren't perfect all the way until the very last detail has been covered, or the person who is able to take pleasure from the process every step of the way?</resource>
  <resource id="119.525">if the goals are similar, which one would you prefer to be?</resource>
  <resource id="119.526">Now which one are you most of the time?</resource>
  <resource id="119.527">Friendship works the same way- some people only appreciate friendships which are productive and goal-oriented, whereas there are also friendships that meander along the way, and each moment can be as interesting and rewarding as the ones before and after.</resource>
  <resource id="119.528">This works in reverse as well, with more negative effects and outcomes, obviously, any you seldom realize it until it's too late.</resource>
  <resource id="119.529">It can be really difficult to appreciate just what a friendship really means to you, especially when it's something you can take for granted fairly easily if you aren't careful.</resource>
  <resource id="119.530">I know I'm guilty of that all the time.</resource>
  <resource id="119.531">I found a really honest adage that goes like this: The past is gone, the future's unknown, but today's a gift- that's why they call it "the present"- it may seem like a silly sentiment, but it makes a lot of sense.</resource>
  <resource id="119.532">We take a lot of shit for granted, and we can get really caught up in little problems that seem inescapable, moments come and go, and our actions and inactions towards the people closest to us will either draw them closer to us or push them away.</resource>
  <resource id="119.533">Often we fail to realize what we've lost until something becomes too distant and difficult to regain.</resource>
  <resource id="119.534">Old wounds fester into something that can't be healed, neglect becomes forgetfulness which then becomes amnesia, and before long you wonder if it ever happened.</resource>
  <resource id="119.535">It sucks, and it takes effort to keep a swerving friendship from heading down these sort of paths, but the effort far outweighs the consequences of failing to do so.</resource>
  <resource id="119.536">So what does this mean to me then?</resource>
  <resource id="119.537">Fuck if I know.</resource>
  <resource id="119.538">It means I have some tough choices to make.</resource>
  <resource id="119.539">I can only change my own mind, so whatever efforts I expend have to be met with some sort of equal efforts or the process goes nowhere and frustrates me the entire way.</resource>
  <resource id="119.540">Is it worth it, or is it better to just let fate play out its' hand and look for a new deal?</resource>
  <resource id="119.541">There's usually no way to know until it's too late regardless.</resource>
  <resource id="119.542">I've come this far with less insight, so I guess I'll make it to wherever I'm going one way or another, but it's nice to think it won't always be a long, lonely road.</resource>
  <resource id="119.543">I guess I do what I can to make the most of what I have, if it's not enough then it likely never was, and in that case, at least I know I tried.</resource>
  <resource id="119.544">If being a friend isn't about trying, then I've been taking the wrong approach all along.</resource>

  <resource id="120.545">As of late, it seems that everything my parents do, they do it just to annoy me. They're great parents.</resource>
  <resource id="120.546">I love them.</resource>
  <resource id="120.547">They're funny and kind and they usually have my best interest in mind, but lately.</resource>

  <resource id="120.549">Everything that goes wrong turns into this colassal ordeal between us.</resource>
  <resource id="120.550">I'm not going to go into specifics here, but it almost always ends up in yelling and tears.</resource>
  <resource id="120.551">I was thinking about our most recent spat today at dinner and wondering why the hell everything turns out this way.</resource>
  <resource id="120.552">I never react to my friends this way when they do something that pisses me off.</resource>
  <resource id="120.553">My only plausible explanation is that I want out.</resource>
  <resource id="120.554">No matter how much I love them, I want to be independent and living on my own, providing for myself and on the road to success.</resource>
  <resource id="120.555">Now, I know that I will reach this place soon enough, but damn it feels like it is taking forever.</resource>
  <resource id="120.556">Even though I am eternally grateful for the free lodging and food, and the mass amounts of entertainment they provide me with, I'm sick of being 20 years old and living with my parents, even though I love them.</resource>
  <resource id="120.557">And this fact is coming to the surface in ridiculous ways.</resource>
  <resource id="120.558">I know its normal for someone who's in college to be living with their parents, but that doesn't quell the wish to be independent and free.</resource>

  <resource id="122.569">I have been TRYING to post for three days, but bloody Spaces was having issues (errors on pages) and I couldn't do it - my Wanker Boss post was due to be posted on Thursday!!</resource>
  <resource id="122.570">Further to that by the way, I did speak to him about it further when he said "My new food is making me feel really healthy" - yes considering he'd eated two meals of it, and then gone out to dinner, and Friday was going out to lunch with a friend.</resource>
  <resource id="122.571">He's paying $250 a week to eat food, and then eat again.</resource>
  <resource id="122.572">But I asked him about WHY he doesn't cook for himself, and he said he just doesn't have enough time.</resource>
  <resource id="122.573">The look on my face I think said it all.</resource>
  <resource id="122.574">This is the man who gets into the office at 10:30am, leaves by 3pm, takes 20minutes to get to the office, dry cleans all his clothes, has a cleaner, doesn't have a wife or family to chase after - and he doesn't have time?I explained that I travel 1.5 hours each way, every day to go to work, I go to the gym more than he does, I cook my meals, I have a life, and I have a house to look after.</resource>
  <resource id="122.575">Where is HIS time going?</resource>
  <resource id="122.576">"I choose to do more important things with my time."</resource>
  <resource id="122.577">Let me see - golf, sitting on a beach drinking coffee, bitching about money, being a complete elitest snob.</resource>
  <resource id="122.578">great life choices right there.</resource>
  <resource id="122.579">But his comment proved to me exactly how much of a wanker he is. I mean "more important things".</resource>
  <resource id="122.580">no wonder he doesn't have a girlfrend if his definition of more important things than actually looking after yourself like an adult isn't important enough.</resource>
  <resource id="122.581">He also makes me feel like a pathetic human being for a) actually ENJOYING the grocery shopping and b)can't afford to spend $1,500 a week on food and someone to clean for me.</resource>
  <resource id="122.582">Urgh.</resource>
  <resource id="122.583">Going to have to find some other employment I think before I go postal with his snobby comments.</resource>
  <resource id="122.584">I think though, what pisses me most off about the food delivery issue - is that he has chosen the easy "I don't have to do anything" option.</resource>
  <resource id="122.585">If I could afford the food, I would probably do it myself, but Jenny Craig was expensive enough, and that was $100 a week, not $250, and I didn't have a mortgage then.</resource>
  <resource id="122.586">But since he has chosen this option, it's just really irritating me, because he has no concept of a weight problem - he just is lazy.</resource>
  <resource id="122.587">He could EASILY cook his own food - his kitchen probably cost more than half my house.</resource>
  <resource id="122.588">But he's NEVER actually used it.</resource>
  <resource id="122.589">AARRGGHH!!!</resource>
  <resource id="122.590">Sorry for the ranting post, but I'm just really annoyed that here I am, struggling with all my internal demons about my weight loss, and someone like this, with no concept of struggle, can just pay someone to lose it for him.</resource>

  <resource id="124.618">Well our fridge died on Wednesday.</resource>
  <resource id="124.619">And I found out in the most annoying way.</resource>
  <resource id="124.620">I woke up on Wednesday morning, bright and early (as I do) to go into work/uni.</resource>
  <resource id="124.621">I walked over to the heater as the first port of call and was very surprised when 'oh!' it wouldn't turn on.</resource>
  <resource id="124.622">Now I thought at first that maybe it had broken the night before, after I'd gone to bed or something.</resource>
  <resource id="124.623">But then one of my housemates, who was already up, informed me that no, it was that the electricity wasn't working anywhere in the house.</resource>
  <resource id="124.624">Well my first thought was 'bloody hell' and out I went to check the boxy thing, only to find that the safety switch had tripped.</resource>
  <resource id="124.625">Trying to turn it back on only got me another automatic trip as lights flashed on for a brief moment, and then suddenly back off.</resource>
  <resource id="124.626">Grrrr - I then spent the next 10 minutes or so turning everything off in the house, switching the safety switch back on, and then sequentially turning everything back on until the safety was tripped.</resource>
  <resource id="124.627">Which is how I discovered that the fridge was to blame.</resource>
  <resource id="124.628">We tried everything to make sure it wasn't the plug/circuit itself.</resource>
  <resource id="124.629">But no, it was the fridge.</resource>
  <resource id="124.630">We thought for a while about what to do, not really being able to afford either a new fridge OR to fix this one.</resource>
  <resource id="124.631">At first one of my housemates thought about possibly buying a new fridge for themselves, but that idea was sadly left behind due to monetary issues.</resource>
  <resource id="124.632">In then end my other housemate's lovely girlfriend (love you heaps babes!)</resource>
  <resource id="124.633">offered to give us her fridge (woooo!).</resource>

  <resource id="125.639">As we wrote in a recent posting, even in a favorable political climate Democratic candidates face a significant challenge in turning out their base voters.</resource>
  <resource id="125.640">Despite widespread dissatisfaction among Democrats with the Bush administration and overall Republican governance, we detect no real signs so far (at least in Harris County) of a groundswell to actually vote in November.</resource>
  <resource id="125.641">An oft-repeated notion in recent weeks, however, has been that this year Republicans too will have a difficult time turning out their party faithful on November 7th.</resource>
  <resource id="125.642">The argument goes that anger nationally over rising gas prices and health care costs, a protracted, expensive war with no conclusion in sight, and a perception among religious conservatives that George W. Bush has failed to deliver on the social issues that motivate them has taken a toll with GOP base voters.</resource>
  <resource id="125.643">Here in Texas we add unhappiness with Governor Rick Perry and the Republican-controlled State Legislature over the business tax and failure to pass property tax appraisal caps to the mix, as well as the coming campaign ugliness between Governor Good Hair and rival Carole Keeton Strayhorn, and we have a recipe for depressed GOP turnout in November.</resource>
  <resource id="125.644">Well, maybe.</resource>
  <resource id="125.645">As noted in the latest issue of US News &amp; World Report, new polling has Republican insiders feeling pretty darn good about turning out their folks this fall, with confidence that they will vote to return their party's elected officials to power.</resource>
  <resource id="125.646">The article cites a recent strategic memo to national GOP Party Chair Ken Mehlman from Market Strategies, which highlights polling (granted, six-week old polling) showing the base is in line and ready to hit the polls.</resource>
  <resource id="125.647">Is this spin or is it true?</resource>
  <resource id="125.648">Obviously no way to tell at this point, but any Democratic victory strategy that assumes weak Republican turnout as a key to winning is folly.</resource>
  <resource id="125.649">Democrats should count on having to win in spite of solid GOP voter performance -- any dropoff will be gravy.</resource>
  <resource id="125.650">To be safe, just remember that old joke about the Republican voter who drives past his polling place once a week, just to make sure there's not an election going on.</resource>
  <resource id="125.651">Except it's no joke.</resource>
  <resource id="125.652">In other words, the mantra for Democratic candidates this political season: persuade everyone you can, turn out your base, and assume all the other guy's usual folks will vote.</resource>
  <resource id="125.653">In other words Democrats, work like hell until November 7th.</resource>

  <resource id="126.667">i want him, all of him, to be mine all mine!</resource>
  <resource id="126.668">i am his all his already, i know this and i hope he does too.</resource>
  <resource id="126.669">i want to be everything he needs and more.</resource>
  <resource id="126.670">and ive learned from my past relationship what to do and what not to do and watching what i say and how i say it and.</resource>
  <resource id="126.671">ALL these things, im more aware of the relationship and it status and im not ,.</resource>
  <resource id="126.672">i duno, im kinda losing track of wht i want to say here.</resource>
  <resource id="126.673">alls im saying is that I think im going through the BEST relationship ive ever had and i dont want to lose Jamie, ever.</resource>
  <resource id="126.674">i better not, considering the circumstances.</resource>
  <resource id="126.675">but NO i do not deny the fact that someday it could all come crashing down, as many things, especially in my life, often do.</resource>
  <resource id="126.676">so no i wont have my head too high up my ass about it, but im noot going to sit here and think/dread it everyday either.</resource>
  <resource id="126.677">i will cherish him ad love him and let him know im there and i care for him everyday that we have together.</resource>
  <resource id="126.678">even our argument are something i cherish, they're so quick and to the point, while staying cute and funny/friendly the whole time, and then its over.</resource>
  <resource id="126.679">POOF its done and we are back to ourselves again.</resource>
  <resource id="126.680">chatting away or smoking or kissing or whatever it is we do other than argue at the time.</resource>
  <resource id="126.681">it always manages to be cute too.</resource>
  <resource id="126.682">somehow.</resource>
  <resource id="126.683">its completely unlike anything i had with chris, rerally, but jamie has a lot of personality like chris did.</resource>
  <resource id="126.684">in his tantrums especially.</resource>
  <resource id="126.685">:) its cute, but it doesnt piss me off ever because (like the smart guy he is) jamie doesnt take it out on me! speaking of which.</resource>
  <resource id="126.686">yesterday i realised what a change in relationship this is for me. my past longest relationships, somehow, were also my most abusive ones.</resource>
  <resource id="126.687">stephen was a little abusive, mainly with words and feelings directed at me / to make me feel bad.</resource>
  <resource id="126.688">chris had a problem with words too,and his anger.</resource>
  <resource id="126.689">and eventually he started hitting me (supposedly playing, but still with strength even after i told him repeatively that hie hurts me and doesnt know his own strength) even more so, even after years and years of me being the instigator in the relationship and after TELLING him that he was a shitty boyfriend and asking him to treat me like a girlfriend and giving him uggestions even as to how to treat me. he was oblivius and retarded about us and what I needed form him.</resource>
  <resource id="126.690">he could car eless about anything and everything as long as he got his way everything was alright.</resource>
  <resource id="126.691">other than that hed get offended or pissed off or ignorant about it.</resource>
  <resource id="126.692">stupid ass hole!</resource>
  <resource id="126.693">gudam, why did i waste so much time on his sorry ass?</resource>
  <resource id="126.694">can someone tell me please?!</resource>
  <resource id="126.695">oh yeh, i was sub-conciously restraining myself and waiting for Jamie >:)~</resource>

<block id="block 127">
  <resource id="127.696">Let's try and finish Sunday now for the third time, before it is Sunday again!</resource>
  <resource id="127.697">After church I went to one of my best friend's house for lunch.</resource>
  <resource id="127.698">My mother was invited too.</resource>
  <resource id="127.699">I saw the guy I went to a dance with once back at school there at her house.</resource>
  <resource id="127.700">Haven't seen him in ages.</resource>
  <resource id="127.701">It's her brother's best friend.</resource>
  <resource id="127.702">Goes figure he'd be there.</resource>
  <resource id="127.703">Hm, was a bit weird.</resource>
  <resource id="127.704">Anyhow not important though.</resource>
  <resource id="127.705">We had a good lunch with Gino Genelli ice-cream!</resource>
  <resource id="127.706">(However you spell the Genelli part) Ah, we talked about Anri's ex and her mom mentioned how Anri was angry with her dad the one time the ex visited, cos her dad kept him busy most of the day.</resource>
  <resource id="127.707">Oh ya we were talking about Land Rovers!</resource>
  <resource id="127.708">Anyhow her dad asked her then at the table but why would you be angry with your dad.</resource>
  <resource id="127.709">She said something like she wanted to see him too and then her father blurted out, "You wanted to smootch!"</resource>
  <resource id="127.710">"Whahahaha" I nearly cracked myself and don't think I didn't blush.</resource>
  <resource id="127.711">W0rd!</resource>
  <resource id="127.712">Her dad is like, why are you blushing Lani?</resource>
  <resource id="127.713">That was funny.</resource>
  <resource id="127.714">Everyone at the table was giggeling.</resource>
  <resource id="127.715">W0rd I am dead tired!</resource>
  <resource id="127.716">Gonna push through with this!</resource>
  <resource id="127.717">Then Anri wanted to go the beach, cos she just visited for the weekend and has to go back to where she studies in another suburb like hunderds of km's away from the ocean.</resource>
  <resource id="127.718">Her niece and Lizelle came along.</resource>
  <resource id="127.719">We went in my car, cos apparently I have music.</resource>
  <resource id="127.720">That be the only reason, cos everyone is scared of driving with me.  >.> Don't ask.</resource>
  <resource id="127.721">:P I drive well now though, yep I do!</resource>
  <resource id="127.722">We sat on the beach and mostly I felt like sleeping.</resource>
  <resource id="127.723">but don't think they would let you do that.</resource>
  <resource id="127.724">NooooOOoo.</resource>
  <resource id="127.725">I took lots of photo's!</resource>
  <resource id="127.726">Now that was fun.</resource>
  <resource id="127.727">Will try and upload them somewhere or do something or I will see!</resource>
  <resource id="127.728">Okies!</resource>
  <resource id="127.729">I took photo's of this little girl swimming in the ocean.</resource>
  <resource id="127.730">The water is freezing cold by the way and it is winter and we sat there dressed warmly!</resource>
  <resource id="127.731">Somehow Anri got the idea in her head that I had to go test the water so that she can take photo's and like that was not enough I had to throw Baywatch moves.</resource>
  <resource id="127.732">You know that Baywatch running style from that tv program.</resource>
  <resource id="127.733">Now that was embarresing!</resource>
  <resource id="127.734">Funny photo's came out there.</resource>
  <resource id="127.735">I wanted to take photo's of Kiteboarders, but there were none!</resource>
  <resource id="127.736">Just guys flying their kites.</resource>
  <resource id="127.737">=/ And some guy on a prepelled engine driven kite thing that was in the air.</resource>
  <resource id="127.738">o.O Took a photo of him, he was a bit far though.</resource>
  <resource id="127.739">:p But it looks cool!</resource>
  <resource id="127.740">I would like to just walk around or sit somewhere where lotsa people are and take photo's of them, especially like action photo's!</resource>
  <resource id="127.741">LOVE IT!</resource>
  <resource id="127.742">It is like doing my art.</resource>
  <resource id="127.743">I get lost in it.</resource>
  <resource id="127.744">I totally zone out.</resource>
  <resource id="127.745">We went to Anri's house for cake and coffee.</resource>
  <resource id="127.746">Hmmm.</resource>
  <resource id="127.747">cake ^.^ ICE-CREAM!</resource>
  <resource id="127.748">Coffeee and dark chocolate!</resource>
  <resource id="127.749">I am craving it for hours now.</resource>
  <resource id="127.750">Lizelle wanted to go to the movies and I wanted to go to church and Anri I don't know what.</resource>
  <resource id="127.751">We sat there 'trying to decide' what we are going to do.</resource>
  <resource id="127.752">We almost sat there for an hour.</resource>
  <resource id="127.753">Lizelle didn't want to go to church.</resource>
  <resource id="127.754">That was as clear as daylight.</resource>
  <resource id="127.755">So we basicly had to wait for Anri to decide.</resource>
  <resource id="127.756">Hm.</resource>
  <resource id="127.757">Really sad how we can actually sit and wonder in your one hand is God and the other hand is a movie.</resource>
  <resource id="127.758">what do you pick.</resource>
  <resource id="127.759">(Non-christians, don't worry about this part I am just expressing my thoughts, doesn't mean I don't accept you still as a person, just kinda thinking out loud to people that believe the same as me.) Hmmm.</resource>
  <resource id="127.760">so we went and it was nice to be there!</resource>
  <resource id="127.761">:p</resource>
  <resource id="127.762">They went to the movies afterwards.</resource>
  <resource id="127.763">Anri promised to come to my house after the movie to keep me awake while I work.</resource>
  <resource id="127.764">Didn't think she would do it, but hey!</resource>
  <resource id="127.765">I sat there drawing and uhm the phone rang and it was the police.</resource>
  <resource id="127.766">Ye.</resource>
  <resource id="127.767">I am too tired now.</resource>
  <resource id="127.768">will finish later</resource>
</block>

<block id="block 128">
  <resource id="128.769">I want to pose a serious question to anyone out there that chooses to read this.</resource>
  <resource id="128.770">If you were given the choice between life and death, which one would you choose?</resource>
  <resource id="128.771">No, I'm not a stupid chick for those of you that may be wondering.</resource>
  <resource id="128.772">The choice does seem quite  obvious to me.  But what if you knew you were gonna die, like possibly sooner than later, for whatever reason.</resource>
  <resource id="128.773">Would you be careful and try to preserve every moment you have left?</resource>
  <resource id="128.774">Or would you say to hell with everything and live each moment like it's the last one.</resource>
  <resource id="128.775">I have a friend that is gonna die, probably sooner than later, and I was  angry because some of the choices he has made in the last few years have cut his time down to virtually nothing.</resource>
  <resource id="128.776">To me, there was no reasoning for his behavior.</resource>
  <resource id="128.777">I couldn't understand how, despite his circumstances, why he would choose to forfeit a longer, healthier life for a shorter, faster, seemingly unfulfilling one.</resource>
  <resource id="128.778">So I tried to step out of myself for a minute and look at things the way he may have been viewing them.</resource>
  <resource id="128.779">Imagine you are young and healthy.</resource>
  <resource id="128.780">An athelete.</resource>
  <resource id="128.781">The whole world and it's endless possibilities are  stretched out before you.</resource>
  <resource id="128.782">You have wonderful friends that love and cherish you.</resource>
  <resource id="128.783">And for first time, you have what you think is real, true love in your life.</resource>
  <resource id="128.784">You are smart, attractive, and ambitious.</resource>
  <resource id="128.785">You are virtually unstoppable.</resource>
  <resource id="128.786">All you have to do is decide which opportunity you would like to take advantage of first.</resource>
  <resource id="128.787">Then things start to take a turn in an unexpected direction.</resource>
  <resource id="128.788">What you thought to be true love has become a serious, dramatic rollercoaster of sorts.</resource>
  <resource id="128.789">Think constant arguing,  lies and deception, money mismanagement, and infidelity.</resource>
  <resource id="128.790">Then, it gets worse and escalates into verbal, then physical abuse.</resource>
  <resource id="128.791">In your heart, you still have love for this person, but you know that you have to put some distance between yourself and this situation before it has any hope of getting better.</resource>
  <resource id="128.792">So you decide to join the military.</resource>
  <resource id="128.793">You figure, 'Hey, I might as well use this opportunity to see the world, make some money, and get an education and a marketable skill.'</resource>
  <resource id="128.794">The world is still yours for the taking.</resource>
  <resource id="128.795">So you make an appointment with a recruiter for an interview and physical.</resource>
  <resource id="128.796">Everything goes well with the interview.</resource>
  <resource id="128.797">The recruiter tells you that the technology field in which you are interested is growing rapidly and there are all types of jobs available that you can parlay into a lucrative career once you retire from the service.</resource>
  <resource id="128.798">You leave there with a renewed sense of purpose and vow to take full advantage of this experience.</resource>
  <resource id="128.799">You go home, wait two weeks, then return to the recruiter's office for the results of your background check and physical.</resource>
  <resource id="128.800">The recruiter comes in the office with a look of sadness and disappointment.</resource>
  <resource id="128.801">You think to yourself that maybe you had too many traffic tickets, or maybe there was something small in your past that has presented you from being selected to join the military.</resource>
  <resource id="128.802">The look on the recruiter's face is unmistakable.</resource>
  <resource id="128.803">You begin to prepare yourself to hear bad news and immediately go into self preservation mode to plan out your next move.</resource>
  <resource id="128.804">He begins to speak while you're planning, "I'm sorry to have to tell you this(ok, I can move back home for a while and go back to school and work on my degree.</resource>
  <resource id="128.805">), but we won't be able to welcome you into the Armed Forces(or I could do some traveling and explore the country.</resource>
  <resource id="128.806">We have the results from your physical(I know, I'm gonna do some volunteer work with kids in the community.</resource>
  <resource id="128.807">), and you have tested positive for HIV(---------)."</resource>
  <resource id="128.808">So what do you do?</resource>
  <resource id="128.809">This is the story as it was given to me, and when I heard it I was pissed.</resource>
  <resource id="128.810">First, because I could already piece together the backdrop of the story.</resource>
  <resource id="128.811">I could definitely relate to being lied to and cheated on by someone that you love like you have never loved anyone else before.</resource>
  <resource id="128.812">When I was younger, I was 'in love' with a guy and I believed all the bullshit that fell out of his mouth until the day I had to sit up in a clinic to get tested for STD's.</resource>
  <resource id="128.813">See, I knew he had cheated.</resource>
  <resource id="128.814">Hell, I had even driven his car into a lake because of it(tell you more about that on another blog entry.</resource>
  <resource id="128.815">lol).</resource>
  <resource id="128.816">But he assured me that he had used a condom and that I was the only one that he was having unprotected sex with.</resource>
  <resource id="128.817">So imagine my surprise  when I was about to engage in activities with him and saw an of color coming from you know where.</resource>
  <resource id="128.818">So I'm in this clinic when I should be in school, and I tell the nurse all about the nasty things I've been doing with this jerk.</resource>
  <resource id="128.819">She then tells me that she's gonna test me for gonorrhea, but also that she's gonna have to test me for HIV.</resource>
  <resource id="128.820">I'm like, "For what?"</resource>
  <resource id="128.821">She tells me that if I was with a person that was infected with gonorrhea, what makes me think that person didn't have anything else?</resource>
  <resource id="128.822">I couldn't answer her.</resource>
  <resource id="128.823">Really, what did make me think that?</resource>
  <resource id="128.824">I was pretty out of it for the rest of my visit there, and for the next two weeks I walked around in a fog thinking about how at 18, my young life could be cut short because I chose to trust someone else inspite of my insticnts and commons sense.</resource>
  <resource id="128.825">I would have given this man, who obviously had little regard for me, my life in exchange for his bullshit and lies.</resource>
  <resource id="128.826">Fortunately, my test results came back negative for both gonorrhea and HIV.</resource>
  <resource id="128.827">I was of course thankful, but I realized something very important during that time.</resource>
  <resource id="128.828">I realized that my life belongs to me.  Fuck the bullshit.</resource>
  <resource id="128.829">The second reason I was pissed was because not only was my friend is dying from this disease and has had it the entire time that we have been friends, but to my knowledge has not taken the appropriate care of himself that a person with HIV should be taking.</resource>
  <resource id="128.830">He never went to see an infectious disease specialist.</resource>
  <resource id="128.831">He never took any medications other than a multi-vitamin.</resource>
  <resource id="128.832">He partied just as hard as I did, drank and smoked just as much weed as me.  So after I learned of his condition, I thought to myself, "Is my friend trying to die?"</resource>
  <resource id="128.833">When we first became friends he was an athelete, so he was pretty fit for the most part.</resource>
  <resource id="128.834">I had never known to do much of anything unhealthy and  he was one of those health conscious, work out fanatics.</resource>
  <resource id="128.835">Maybe he maintained that lifestyle in the beginning because he thought that  he could somehow combat his illness this way.</resource>
  <resource id="128.836">I wonder what changed his mind about that?</resource>
  <resource id="128.837">Could it be that he realized that no matter what he did, there was nothing that would get rid of his disease, so he lived and played hard and masked his pain with lots of partying, drugs, and lots of random, annonymous sex?</resource>
  <resource id="128.838">I've asked him about this, and he has never really given me an answer.</resource>
  <resource id="128.839">But I think about it alot, and I wonder exactly when did he decide to die?</resource>
  <resource id="128.840">I wonder how many other people have made the same decision that he made.</resource>
  <resource id="128.841">I wonder what choices I would have made differently had that nurse from the clinic given me different results.</resource>
  <resource id="128.842">So what would you do?</resource>
  <resource id="128.843">Would you choose to live, or would you choose to die?</resource>
  <resource id="128.844">The question itself is mostly rhetorical, presented to raise awareness and provoke thought moreso than response.</resource>
  <resource id="128.845">However, if you are so compelled to do so, please leave your thoughts and comments.</resource>
  <resource id="128.846">All will be greatly appreciated.</resource>

<block id="block 141">
  <resource id="141.11">I've been thinking a great deal about the importance of ritual.</resource>
  <resource id="141.12">Not religious ritual (like baptism) or societal ritual (like shaking hands), but personal ritual.</resource>
  <resource id="141.13">I've been wondering which aspects of a behavior determine whether it's ritual or rut.</resource>
  <resource id="141.14">And how I can possibly develop more rituals and fewer ruts in my life.</resource>
  <resource id="141.15">This has all come about because lately, I've been thinking about the Big Picture.</resource>
  <resource id="141.16">Granted, not the global, world-issues Big Picture, just MY Big Picture.</resource>
  <resource id="141.17">The same thought keeps coming back to me: I lived my first 40 years largely as a leaf, blowing about in the wind.</resource>
  <resource id="141.18">Like that bag in American Beauty.</resource>
  <resource id="141.19">While its dance was beautiful, in a way.</resource>
  <resource id="141.20">it was not self-determined.</resource>
  <resource id="141.21">I want the next 40 years to be lived on purpose.</resource>
  <resource id="141.22">How do I do that?</resource>
  <resource id="141.23">And how can I start now?</resource>
  <resource id="141.24">One of my most surprising observations about this whole ritual thing is how much easier it was to establish new rituals when I was on location, as opposed to being at home.</resource>
  <resource id="141.25">And, the corollary: how easy it is to slip into old habits, once back at home.</resource>
  <resource id="141.26">[It makes sense that there is concern for addicts or alcoholics who successfully gets straight or sober some place other than where they live.</resource>
  <resource id="141.27">and then eventually have to return home to old triggers.]</resource>
  <resource id="141.28">So anyway.</resource>
  <resource id="141.29">Ritual.</resource>
  <resource id="141.30">Rut.</resource>
  <resource id="141.31">I guess the difference is twofold: rituals are performed by choice and are psychologically, emotionally, or physically beneficial, whereas ruts, on the other hand, are not executed so much on purpose, as they somehow come about mostly by default.</resource>
  <resource id="141.32">That, and they may not be exactly great for you.</resource>
  <resource id="141.33">I think ritual is important because it lends predictability, structure, and things to look forward to - to our otherwise harried, demanding, and random lives.</resource>
  <resource id="141.34">I'm not advocating all-structure, all-the-time or anything.</resource>
  <resource id="141.35">But I do know the perils of a life devoid of ritual.</resource>
  <resource id="141.36">and it is fraught with procrastination and rut.</resource>
  <resource id="141.37">At least in my experience.</resource>
  <resource id="141.38">I'd like to say that my rituals are more active and crunchy.</resource>
  <resource id="141.39">but alas, they aren't (yet).</resource>
  <resource id="141.40">Here are some rituals I HAVE managed to cultivate:</resource>
  <resource id="141.41">* Every day when I come home from work, the first thing I do is put on my pajamas.</resource>
  <resource id="141.42">Maybe that doesn't sound like a ritual.</resource>
  <resource id="141.43">but when I started thinking about things I do regularly that I enjoy, that's definitely one of them.</resource>
  <resource id="141.44">* Every other Saturday, Catharine and I get manicures and pedicures.</resource>
  <resource id="141.45">A time to relax, be pampered, catch up.</resource>
  <resource id="141.46">and we come away with the cutest toes ever!</resource>
  <resource id="141.47">* A ritual I absolutely adore is going to the outdoor screenings at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery during the summer.</resource>
  <resource id="141.48">There are all sorts of mini-rituals that go into this regular event, including the collection of picnic dinner items and the precision methodology by which one gets the perfect spot on the lawn.</resource>
  <resource id="141.49">* When I'm NOT working, I have been known to take myself to brunch on the weekends: just me and whatever novel I'm currently enjoying.</resource>
  <resource id="141.50">* Gardening used to be a cherished ritual of mine, but now my house just looks barren and abandoned.</resource>
  <resource id="141.51">Maybe after this show ends, I'll be able to start a new garden.</resource>
  <resource id="141.52">I've just realized in trying to make a list of my rituals, that I really don't have many.</resource>
  <resource id="141.53">How very telling.</resource>
  <resource id="141.54">This is not good.</resource>
  <resource id="141.55">When I imagine the rituals of others, things like a daily, morning run (something hard for me to fathom, I admit), meditation, feeding the ducks on Thursdays, after-dinner strolls with your family, poker night, date night.</resource>
  <resource id="141.56">and the like are what come to mind.</resource>
  <resource id="141.57">My list of ruts is long and embarrassing and includes things like:</resource>
  <resource id="141.58">* I'm happy to taste any new flavor of ice cream (I love to try new flavors!), but when it comes to ordering, it's always Mint Chip.</resource>
  <resource id="141.59">Always.</resource>
  <resource id="141.60">and.</resource>
  <resource id="141.61">* My fear of insomnia keeps me from going to bed when I'm really tired.</resource>
  <resource id="141.62">Is that a rut.</resource>
  <resource id="141.63">or just something totally mental that I do?</resource>
  <resource id="141.64">Anyway, I don't want to sully this post with MY list of rituals and ruts.</resource>
  <resource id="141.65">I'd like to hear about some of the rituals that you hold dear and why YOU think ritual is important to your life.</resource>
  <resource id="141.66">How do you think we can instill more meaningful rituals into our lives?</resource>

<block id="block 142">
  <resource id="142.67">"The image of cartoonist after cartoonist sitting at folding tables selling comic books is truly a pathetic one.</resource>
  <resource id="142.68">From talking with cartoonists, I get the sense that most of them find it debilitating, too.</resource>
  <resource id="142.69">It's hard, often dreary work.</resource>
  <resource id="142.70">It can be ego-crushing when no one comes to buy anything.</resource>
  <resource id="142.71">I would hate to do it myself."</resource>
  <resource id="142.72">- Bart Beaty, whom I had the pleasure of meeting at the show, from his Conversational Eurocomics column on what SPX could learn from some European conventions</resource>
  <resource id="142.73">I really enjoyed myself at SPX, that delightsome Bethesda megamall of rare and exclusive purchases and the men and women who brought the wares about.</resource>
  <resource id="142.74">Don't sweat it, that's just my perception: I traveled the hour and a half trip down on Saturday with American Hero Chris Mautner (he attained that storied status by agreeing to drive), arrived a half-hour after the doors opened, stayed until 5:30, then went right back home.</resource>
  <resource id="142.75">That means I didn't see the Ignatz Awards, didn't partake of any post-show gatherings, and missed a big chunk of panels.</resource>
  <resource id="142.76">My SPX, in other words, was full of shopping and stalking the aisles.</resource>
  <resource id="142.77">Commerce!</resource>
  <resource id="142.78">Show debuts!</resource>
  <resource id="142.79">I met an awful lot of fine creators, but I hated taking up much of their table time; heaven knows by the afternoon there's a swarm of people waiting to trudge through the byways between tables, and one thousand distractions to attend to.</resource>
  <resource id="142.80">I'd never been to a comics show in my life, so I'd not known any SPX other than what was presented to me there: a pretty swank hotel, a table to pay at in the hall outside, and big ballroom with everyone selling everything inside, and a bunch of other rooms to have educational and informative events in, though all of those were down the hall, around the bend, and down an escalator.</resource>
  <resource id="142.81">There were no signs to direct you to the panels or whatnot, though it wasn't hard to find someone to ask direction of.</resource>
  <resource id="142.82">Still, the separation-by-floor carried a certain symbolism for me when coupled with the atmosphere; upstairs was the carnival of monies and tables, downstairs were the talks and trophies.</resource>
  <resource id="142.83">Upstairs there were masses of shoppers with bags and backpacks and totes, cookies and candies and muffins on certain tables to attract attention, and even a pair of folks operating hand puppets to entice a stray passerby.</resource>
  <resource id="142.84">Downstairs there were hushed people crouched before open doors, the portals leading to capacity talks.</resource>
  <resource id="142.85">There was some sort of bizarre crystal bridge hanging by strings above the escalator, and it certainly did feel like you were crossing into a different, segmented zone of the convention.</resource>
  <resource id="142.86">All of it in a building off the highway, malls and fences and the whipping metal sea of vehicles all around it.</resource>
  <resource id="142.87">To say there was no color at all would be misleading, since it was a nice day and there were a number of trees and things, but I did not detect any local pulse at all.</resource>
  <resource id="142.88">It was a hotel, on a road.</resource>
  <resource id="142.89">I went out for lunch with Chris and Gina Gagliano of First Second; food became curiously hard to find within hiking distance (in the interests of full disclosure, my mastery of direction also had us walking the wrong way for a good while).</resource>
  <resource id="142.90">After we passed by a large parking lot promising a furniture blowout sale, as well as a haunted attraction and possibly ponies or something in the back, we decided to turn around and stop at a little diner we'd passed on the way.</resource>
  <resource id="142.91">It was decent food, Gina got us very enthused about some of First Second's upcoming releases involving Eddie Campbell, Gipi, and the ever-prolific Joann Sfar, Chris blinked a lot in the direction of his sandwich since he hadn't been to sleep since October 2nd, and I told Gina the secret of why there are no pictures on this site (I was bullied by a JPEG in high school).</resource>
  <resource id="142.92">But we didn't hang around.</resource>
  <resource id="142.93">We hurried back from the gray highway to the center of comics and people, followed close behind by haunted ponies who'd just bought cheap Barcaloungers for their ghost stable and were now jonesing for independent comics.</resource>
  <resource id="142.94">Oh, but don't presume that I'm somehow upset at the purchase-happy nature of the show's afternoon - far from it!</resource>
  <resource id="142.95">I love walking around for things to buy, and traveling less than two hours to arrive at the comics spread of my dreams won't raise too many personal hackles, let me tell you.</resource>
  <resource id="142.96">I also made it a point to say hello to everyone there with whom I'd ever communicated on the internet, though I couldn't find anyone matching Johanna Draper Carlson's description and I totally missed Douglas Wolk.</resource>
  <resource id="142.97">But I saw a lot of good people, and finally put some faces to names.</resource>
  <resource id="142.98">I'm also really glad I had Chris with me, since he knew a lot of faces that I didn't; he made a fine guide, though one of us would occasionally wander away from the other in the vein of the old NES version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, though I'm unsure as to which one of us was Bob Hoskins.</resource>
  <resource id="142.99">Actually, I think maybe the best thing about SPX is how everyone is kind of pressed together, comics placed near one another seemingly without much concern for subject matter coherency (I heard it was a bit different in prior years, with multiple selling rooms and all); if the creators in attendance and the books on display weren't a comprehensive picture of English-language non-superhero comics, there was at least enough diversity to manage the illusion of comprehensiveness.</resource>
  <resource id="142.100">A diverse audience too, everything from young to old, from old-school nerds to stylish-looking folk, from aged hippies to teenage Goths.</resource>
  <resource id="142.101">To look only at this crowd, you'd imagine that there was no question as to the diversity of the comics-reading audience.</resource>
  <resource id="142.102">I went to two panels, Scott McCloud's and Brian Chippendale's.</resource>
  <resource id="142.103">There was nowhere to sit in the former, since I got there late, so I sort of drifted in and out of hearing distance.</resource>
  <resource id="142.104">At one point, McCloud began vigorously drawing a chart to illustrate different types of artists, all the while telling stories of the message board clashes between forces on places like the Comics Journal board.</resource>
  <resource id="142.105">Someone behind me turned to someone else and whispered "It's just like Civil War."</resource>
  <resource id="142.106">Afterward (a solid half-hour afterward, I believe), McCloud could be seen out in the hallway, taking questions from anyone who happened to want to talk to him away from the bustle of his table upstairs.</resource>
  <resource id="142.107">The Chippendale talk was different, a highly entertaining, digression-prone ramble by the artist through his history and procedure, moderated by Dan Nadel and with extra bonus contributions from Brian Ralph, who was seated in the back of the room.</resource>
  <resource id="142.108">Nobody was particularly brusque at SPX, at least from among the artists, but I found Chippendale to be consistently the most emphatic and friendly creator around.</resource>
  <resource id="142.109">And I bought a good deal of stuff too.</resource>
  <resource id="142.110">I tried to follow Tom's rule of not buying anything on my first trip around the room, but that didn't quite hold.</resource>
  <resource id="142.111">I managed to get through the whole show without finding anything I really wanted sold out, however, and I only had to stand in the Line of Shame at the ATM once.</resource>
  <resource id="142.112">BOOKS I GOT:</resource>
  <resource id="142.113">Abraxas and the Earthman by Rick Veitch (debuted at the show, a collection of the Epic Illustrated serial; an additional collection of Veitch's short comics from the same venue is coming soon)</resource>
  <resource id="142.114">Awakening Comics #1-2 by Steve Peters &amp; friends (I reviewed his The Origin of Sparky a few weeks ago; having walked away from the table, and indeed the entire convention, I suddenly realized that I'd forgotten to actually tell Steve Peters who I was - another triumph of intellect!)</resource>
  <resource id="142.115">Cinema Sewer #19 edited by Robin Bougie (new issue of the funny, comics-heavy pamphlet-format magazine devoted entirely to the finest in exploitation and pornographic film - a creator's personality-powered publication, and I assure you that Robin Bougie is in real life exactly the way he portrays himself in the mag)</resource>
  <resource id="142.116">Cold Heat #1-2 (of 12) by Ben Jones &amp; Frank Santoro (#2 debuted at the show; the odd, semi-abstract fantasy/action book that Diamond initially disliked a while back, complaining of its format despite the fact that it's 100% a serialized pamphlet-format comic)</resource>
  <resource id="142.117">Comics Comics #1-2 edited by Timothy Hodler &amp; Dan Nadel (I mentioned this yesterday, but didn't note that I also got a hard copy of issue #1)</resource>
  <resource id="142.118">Dave K. Greatest Hits 1999-2004 by Dave Kiersh (snapped up from the Bodega Distribution table, a collection of work from a prominent minicomics fellow; Kiersh was actually sitting right in front of my the whole time and I had no idea who he was, and when the guy I was paying mentioned that "Dave" was here to see if I wanted it signed, I kind of stared at him dully before getting what was going on - I also totally forgot to buy Leif Goldberg's National Waste #6 and say hi to Heidi MacDonald who was standing next to me at the table a bit earlier, so it was a real hat trick of inattentive triumph)</resource>
  <resource id="142.119">Ed the Happy Clown #2 (of 9) by Chester Brown (the one I was missing - who says you can't score back-issues at these things?!)</resource>
  <resource id="142.120">Fuzz &amp; Pluck in Splitsville #4 (of 5) by Ted Stearn (surely I can't be the only fan of the mighty Fuzz &amp; Pluck; still, I've never seen this in a store, though Fantagraphics had it at their table)</resource>
  <resource id="142.121">House of Twelve, at the movies Vol.</resource>
  <resource id="142.122">2 #1: Heavy Metal by various (from House of Twelve, a free giveaway show debut, parodying the original movie version of the magazine)</resource>
  <resource id="142.123">Krayons Ego by various (very nice 2006 minicomic anthology spoofing Kramers Ergot, though it's most highly reminiscent of Kurt Wolfgang's old Lo-Jinx; a semi-heated, semi-affectionate lampoon of various contemporary independent comics names, Paper Rad or members thereof apparently the most popular target, though the Jeffrey Brown stuff is maybe the nastiest - Chris really liked it when I showed it to him, but then it was all sold out when he went back for a copy of his own)</resource>
  <resource id="142.124">New Tales of Old Palomar #1 (of 3) by Gilbert Hernandez (new miniseries of stand-alone tales, presented in the Ignatz format, debuting at a show featuring the Ignatz Awards; I remember when this was first released I heard it was going to be titled simply 'New Palomar' like it was New X-Men)</resource>
  <resource id="142.125">Ninja by Brian Chippendale (debuted at the show, probably the book of the show, and I've gushed enough already; when I went to Rick Veitch's table, he became momentarily transfixed with the transfixed and murmured "I want to make a book like this!")</resource>
  <resource id="142.126">Paping #11 by various (older issue of a deluxe anthology by some interesting-looking creators; the real showpiece was issue #14, with its solid wood covers and impressive prints 'n comics mishmash interior, the whole thing bound by red shoelaces; I just didn't have the roughly $30 needed to spend on it by that point in the show, though)</resource>
  <resource id="142.127">Project: Romantic by various (debuted at the show, the newest in AdHouse's Project series of anthologies, this one strictly devoted to romance comics)</resource>
  <resource id="142.128">Pulphope.A by Paul Pope (a show exclusive, I think; not the full Pope art book coming soon from AdHouse, but a 200 copy ashcan with some exclusive stuff)</resource>
  <resource id="142.129">R.</resource>
  <resource id="142.130">Kelly's "Trapped in the Closet" Starring Batman (Abridged) by K. Thor Jensen (a reenactment of the continuing American epic, with members of the Batman cast playing each role)</resource>
  <resource id="142.131">Sermons #2 by Kevin Huizenga (found at the Buenaventura Press table, debuted at the show I think; another installment of Huizenga's interesting sketchbook minicomic concept, dedicated wholly to drawings made and notes taken during church services - it's "KH Book #9" in Huizenga's numbering scheme, if you're keeping track)</resource>
  <resource id="142.132">Service Industry by t. edward bak (much-recommended and indeed very impressive 2005 minicomic by bak, who's set to appear in Fantagraphics' MOME at some point in the future; a potent mix of autobiography, fantasy, subconscious yearning, and personal philosophy, all in 28 b&amp;w and color pages)</resource>
  <resource id="142.133">Shadowland by Kim Deitch (the big new Fantagraphics collection of some of my personal favorite underground-era cartoonist's less-seen works, all of it concerning the affairs of an ill-fated family; debuted at the show, and I bought the last copy, so if you couldn't find it you might as well blame me)</resource>
  <resource id="142.134">So it was a nice trip.</resource>
  <resource id="142.135">A lot of good things to have, and good hands to shake.</resource>
  <resource id="142.136">I hope to do it again, and add on a few more convention experience points.</resource>
  <resource id="142.137">I'm not leveled up yet, no sir.</resource>

  <resource id="143.138">My Mother Is A Fish</resource>
  <resource id="143.139">Do you know some tiger sharks sleep?</resource>
  <resource id="143.140">I think it's in the Gulf of Mexico or the Gulf of California, I can't remember which, but there's so much oxygen in the water they actually sleep.</resource>
  <resource id="143.141">I don't sleep.</resource>
  <resource id="143.142">No, it's alright, I've had a lot of time to come to terms with this.</resource>
  <resource id="143.143">Some of my girlfriends have found it a little strange; I think it's one of the reasons they break up with me in the end, as if they need anymore reasons.</resource>
  <resource id="143.144">I just lay in the bed next to them while they snore, or they breathe softly, or they dream, or they do whatever it is sleeping people do.</resource>
  <resource id="143.145">Most of the time, I sit in a chair.</resource>
  <resource id="143.146">I own a bed because it would be weird if I didn't own a bed.</resource>
  <resource id="143.147">People would come over and say, hey, Angel, you don't own a bed, you must be some kind of freak.</resource>
  <resource id="143.148">Because I can't just have a bedroom with bookshelves and dressers, or everyone would know something was wrong with me. And there is something wrong with me, but I just can't figure it out.</resource>
  <resource id="143.149">To try and remedy this, I spend my nights reading.</resource>
  <resource id="143.150">I just finished a book about the importance of dreams.</resource>
  <resource id="143.151">How important can they be?</resource>
  <resource id="143.152">I don't have them and I'm still here.</resource>
  <resource id="143.153">But it was a good read, and if I did have a dream where I had sex with my mother, well, now I'd know what it means.</resource>
  <resource id="143.154">Sometimes, I can't reading about this condition, though.</resource>
  <resource id="143.155">I guess it's hard to read about a condition when you don't know the name of it.</resource>
  <resource id="143.156">I didn't always have this problem.</resource>
  <resource id="143.157">When I was a kid I slept.</resource>
  <resource id="143.158">I think.</resource>
  <resource id="143.159">Actually, I don't remember much about my childhood.</resource>
  <resource id="143.160">All this not sleeping has a terrible way of playing with your memory.</resource>
  <resource id="143.161">I don't only feel like the days stretch on interminably.</resource>
  <resource id="143.162">They really do when there's no end.</resource>
  <resource id="143.163">Just me in my room, reading my books and wondering what life would be like if I slept.</resource>
  <resource id="143.164">Do I go to work again tomorrow morning?</resource>
  <resource id="143.165">I think I do.</resource>
  <resource id="143.166">It's Sunday, but tomorrow might be a holiday.</resource>
  <resource id="143.167">It is, isn't it?</resource>
  <resource id="143.168">But I think I work on that holiday.</resource>
  <resource id="143.169">Nothing has much definition unless I'm staring at a calendar.</resource>
  <resource id="143.170">I actually keep one everywhere, one in my car, one in each room of my apartment, one in my cubicle.</resource>
  <resource id="143.171">How else would I keep all these days straight?</resource>
  <resource id="143.172">It's not like a sleep in on the weekend.</resource>
  <resource id="143.173">I can't always read about this condition, or whatever it may be.</resource>
  <resource id="143.174">I'm beginning to think there may be nothing to it.</resource>
  <resource id="143.175">I'd tell my doctor, but I don't go to a doctor.</resource>
  <resource id="143.176">Otherwise, I'm a totally healthy male of my species.</resource>
  <resource id="143.177">I weigh about 180 lbs, I'm about 5', 10", I don't have anything that seems to be wrong with me. I have these weird scars on my neck.</resource>
  <resource id="143.178">Something from when I was a kid.</resource>
  <resource id="143.179">An accident.</resource>
  <resource id="143.180">And there's the scar on my lip.</resource>
  <resource id="143.181">I don't know where that came from.</resource>
  <resource id="143.182">I would say it was from some drunken night of excess, but I've never blacked out either.</resource>
  <resource id="143.183">I can drink and drink.</resource>
  <resource id="143.184">Oh, I get drunk, but nothing seems to happen to me where I forget.</resource>
  <resource id="143.185">I remember every second, every horrific moment leaning over a toilet and puking.</resource>
  <resource id="143.186">It's unfair that I can remember things like that so well, yet I can't even tell you much about what happened in the rest of my life.</resource>
  <resource id="143.187">Selective memory, they say.</resource>
  <resource id="143.188">Most times, I can't even remember what I did five seconds ago.</resource>
  <resource id="143.189">You'd think that'd be a problem at work, but it's menial stuff.</resource>
  <resource id="143.190">Doesn't require much of a brain to do it.</resource>
  <resource id="143.191">I spend most of my time in my cube typing and filing, thinking about what I read the night before, trying to process it, trying to figure out what is/has been happening to me. Last night, I read As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner.</resource>
  <resource id="143.192">Have you ever read it?</resource>
  <resource id="143.193">It's kind of confusing.</resource>
  <resource id="143.194">I kept having to reread passages until I figured out that it's not chronological.</resource>
  <resource id="143.195">My favorite character is Vardaman.</resource>
  <resource id="143.196">I think he had a point.</resource>
  <resource id="143.197">But I can't remember it right now.</resource>
  <resource id="143.198">I'm at work, and I left the book at home.</resource>
  <resource id="143.199">I'll have to look when I get home.</resource>
  <resource id="143.200">Unless I returned it to the library.</resource>
  <resource id="143.201">I walk to work.</resource>
  <resource id="143.202">When it's nice.</resource>
  <resource id="143.203">Today it's nice.</resource>
  <resource id="143.204">It's a couple miles, but I don't have a lot of people that I have to rush home to see.</resource>
  <resource id="143.205">Just my books these days.</resource>
  <resource id="143.206">I really need to get more friends.</resource>
  <resource id="143.207">My walk takes me by Lake Calhoun.</resource>
  <resource id="143.208">Most days I look at it as I pass by the fishers, the runners, the dog walkers.</resource>
  <resource id="143.209">Every so often, I walk around it.</resource>
  <resource id="143.210">I don't know what it is about the lake.</resource>
  <resource id="143.211">Some days it just lures me. The sun catches fire in the western sky as I start around the trail.</resource>
  <resource id="143.212">A shelf of clouds cover the sky, and Calhoun, choppy from the breeze, glitters only slightly.</resource>
  <resource id="143.213">Just the way I like it.</resource>
  <resource id="143.214">I itch my neck for some reason it itches.</resource>
  <resource id="143.215">Soon the lake will be frozen, everyone walking on top of it.</resource>
  <resource id="143.216">Man triumphing over nature, something like that.</resource>
  <resource id="143.217">I don't get it.</resource>
  <resource id="143.218">Just like the fisherman.</resource>
  <resource id="143.219">Doesn't seem fair, not at all.</resource>
  <resource id="143.220">I amble around the lake, and the people are slowly thinning out.</resource>
  <resource id="143.221">I guess it's getting colder, and it's getting to be time for dinner, or far enough after work, or whatever.</resource>
  <resource id="143.222">I, on the other hand, have nothing to go home to.</resource>
  <resource id="143.223">I should have brought a book with me. Then I could read at the lake</resource>
  <resource id="143.224">I suppose the cold should annoy me. But it doesn't. I begin to take off my shoes.</resource>
  <resource id="143.225">People tell me that the water in the lakes around here isn't that good.</resource>
  <resource id="143.226">But people swim in this, right?</resource>
  <resource id="143.227">And there are plenty of fish.</resource>
  <resource id="143.228">The water can't be that bad.</resource>
  <resource id="143.229">And it's not that cold yet.</resource>
  <resource id="143.230">For some reason, my skin doesn't get cold and I like the water running between my toes.</resource>
  <resource id="143.231">People stare as I dangle my feet into the lake in October.</resource>
  <resource id="143.232">No one is in the lake, and I think everyone thinks something is wrong with me. Something is wrong me, but I still don't know what.</resource>
  <resource id="143.233">The water swirls around my feet, swirls and I have the sudden compunction to jump in.</resource>
  <resource id="143.234">I control it at first.</resource>
  <resource id="143.235">A person walks by me and says something, but I don't know what, and I'm singing something, but I can't place to tune.</resource>
  <resource id="143.236">Something my mother sang to me to put me to sleep.</resource>
  <resource id="143.237">I think.</resource>
  <resource id="143.238">I could be wrong.</resource>
  <resource id="143.239">But where else would I know it from.</resource>
  <resource id="143.240">I don't listen to music, but I know this song.</resource>
  <resource id="143.241">Vardaman is right.</resource>
  <resource id="143.242">I quickly strip.</resource>
  <resource id="143.243">More people are shouting, but I don't hear them, and I don't look at them.</resource>
  <resource id="143.244">I just throw my clothes in a pile.</resource>
  <resource id="143.245">I can see people running at me as I dive into Calhoun.</resource>
  <resource id="143.246">My neck tingles as I hit the water and I sink, blowing bubbles.</resource>
  <resource id="143.247">They slowly stop coming out of my mouth, but my neck continues to tingle.</resource>
  <resource id="143.248">I can't feel my hands or my feet, but I feel fine.</resource>
  <resource id="143.249">For the first time in my life I feel completely normal.</resource>
  <resource id="143.250">I read somewhere that fish don't sleep.</resource>
  <resource id="143.251">Except for some tiger sharks.</resource>

  <resource id="144.252">You're going to hear that a lot from me in the coming weeks, I think.</resource>
  <resource id="144.253">What a suck-ass day this turned out to be.</resource>
  <resource id="144.254">Work was fucked up.</resource>
  <resource id="144.255">Like Alice in Wonderland on a bad acid trip fucked up.</resource>
  <resource id="144.256">Then I get "home", and I am immediately accosted with "can I use.</resource>
  <resource id="144.257">can I borrow.</resource>
  <resource id="144.258">?, can I bum.</resource>
  <resource id="144.259">Mind you, I've been treated like the asshole of the house for the past couple of weeks, and I didn't even do anything at all to deserve it.</resource>
  <resource id="144.260">But it's all good when folks need or want something, isn't it?</resource>
  <resource id="144.261">And then one of them played a song that made me think of my mom, and suddenly, I'm so depressed that all I want to do is go curl up in a ball and die.</resource>
  <resource id="144.262">And now the MAIN instigator in the house has come home.</resource>
  <resource id="144.263">Trying to pull the "he said, she said" routine on me in hopes of getting me to say something that can be used to stab me in the back later.</resource>

<block id="block 145">
  <resource id="145.267">So.</resource>
  <resource id="145.268">This last week at school was nuts- it was the first time that I can remember where I was putting in the hours in the lab, really busting my ass- classes are going well and I feel like it all ties in- which I really like.</resource>
  <resource id="145.269">It's nice kind of being able to put everything together in my head.</resource>
  <resource id="145.270">I'm sure by now most people heard about the really sad disappearance and murder of Michelle-Gardner Quinn, a UVM student.</resource>
  <resource id="145.271">It's pretty awful- there's not much else to say about it.</resource>
  <resource id="145.272">It makes us all take a really good look at how we let our guard down in Burlington but people can be terrible anywhere.</resource>
  <resource id="145.273">I found out about it on the way to Boston this weekend and I was just shocked.</resource>
  <resource id="145.274">I transferred from a school in an unsafe part of a city to UVM and found it to be much more laid back and free.</resource>
  <resource id="145.275">Even just this last week there is a definite change in atmosphere around these parts that is pretty sad.</resource>
  <resource id="145.276">I really can't imagine what her family and friends are going through right now because it's a really unnecessary situation- she did not have to die and that's probably the saddest part.</resource>
  <resource id="145.277">Anyways, I'm not sure there's anything else I can add that hasn't been said over and over.</resource>
  <resource id="145.278">So Boston this weekend- Travis, Lily, and I have never been so lost in our life as we were trying to get there, but give or take 7 or 8 times being lost we had an awesome time visiting Corm and Alex.</resource>
  <resource id="145.279">It was so fun seeing everyone from way back- we ran into Eric and went out to see Michele so it was just so fun.</resource>
  <resource id="145.280">My friends all kick ass and it was nice being in Boston- I'm actually pretty boston retarded considering where I live and how close it is- I'm much better with Brooklyn or Pittsburgh, obv, but it was fun!</resource>
  <resource id="145.281">Now I'm just trying to take everything one day at a time.</resource>
  <resource id="145.282">Work and school are getting a little intense but I've found that I can do it- I just need to stay focused.</resource>
  <resource id="145.283">My brother turns 16 on Wednesday (how.weird.)</resource>
  <resource id="145.284">and I am excited about the little booger haha.</resource>
  <resource id="145.285">Okay, off to clean this room.</resource>
  <resource id="145.286">Last week was so busy that I just TRASHED it.</resource>
  <resource id="145.287">It needs a serious pick up and vacuum.</resource>
  <resource id="145.288">My mom would be so proud of me.</resource>
</block>

<block id="block 146">
  <resource id="146.289">cold, rainy day.</resource>
  <resource id="146.290">no easy transition into this weather; it felt more like winter than fall up on the trail.</resource>
  <resource id="146.291">i took Shelby again.</resource>
  <resource id="146.292">i didn't see her on Wednesday so i was surprised to find her at the shelter this morning.</resource>
  <resource id="146.293">poor girl has been there a l-o-n-g time.</resource>
  <resource id="146.294">she was raring to go.</resource>
  <resource id="146.295">once we got a the top of the trail and started to head down some spastic switch got turned on because she started acting a jumpy, darting all over the place, picking up stones, randomly chewing on tree roots, etc. she probably wanted to play but there's not much room for that on the trail especially on the way down a steep trail.</resource>
  <resource id="146.296">in the process she head-butted my bad knee which hurt and made me limp quite a bit.</resource>
  <resource id="146.297">T was nice enough to swap dogs with me so i didn't have to work at protecting my knee and deal with Shelby at the same time.</resource>
  <resource id="146.298">back at the car, T had Shelby all wrapped up in a towel to warm her.</resource>
  <resource id="146.299">i was surprised to see her sitting so still; spastic switch must have been turned off.</resource>
  <resource id="146.300">T started off with Smiley; a 2-3 year-old shepard-pitbull mix.</resource>
  <resource id="146.301">he was a stray, found wandering Discovery Park.</resource>
  <resource id="146.302">he has a bad left eye which i don't think he has any vision.</resource>
  <resource id="146.303">i don't think he was thrilled with the cold rain but he was diligent in hiking with us.</resource>
  <resource id="146.304">great leash skills, gentle disposition and a cuddler.</resource>
  <resource id="146.305">i ran with Smiley this past Wednesday; he was just released (no one came to claim him) and allowed to go for a run.</resource>
  <resource id="146.306">he was a great running partner and ran right next to me the whole time but he accidentally tripped me which landed me flat on the pavement -- i have a nice large patch of road rash to prove it.</resource>
  <resource id="146.307">during the run we were calling him Lance (since he was nameless) because when he was laying on his back in the grass he would kick his legs like he was riding a bike; i wrote this stuff down on his sheet but i guess the officer's didn't like the name.</resource>

  <resource id="147.319">lol [they are cute brothers, no?]</resource>
  <resource id="147.320">I was scared to see him with a knife.</resource>
  <resource id="147.321">This smile made me more scared.</resource>
  <resource id="147.322">XD</resource>
  <resource id="147.323">He first tore up the toy car.</resource>

  <resource id="147.354">Interact Club - AIDS Walk:</resource>
  <resource id="147.355">This event was sooo fun!</resource>
  <resource id="147.356">It was like an exciting adventure where we walked 6 miles in the cold!</resource>
  <resource id="147.357">It was like 8 in the morning and so.</resource>
  <resource id="147.358">we were freezing to death.</resource>
  <resource id="147.359">and so we try to warm up!</resource>
  <resource id="147.360">Alex, you suck.</resource>
  <resource id="147.361">XD</resource>

  <resource id="147.363">I don't know.</resource>
  <resource id="147.364">Anywho, this balloon man was awesome!</resource>
  <resource id="147.365">I didn't get anything though.</resource>
  <resource id="147.366">But Christina got this cute little piggy.</resource>
  <resource id="147.367">SO, this is where we begin our journey.</resource>
  <resource id="147.368">Yes, there were a lot of heads.</resource>
  <resource id="147.369">Thousands and thousands of people attended.</resource>
  <resource id="147.370">Here we go~!</resource>
  <resource id="147.371">As we walked.</resource>
  <resource id="147.372">and walked some more.</resource>
  <resource id="147.373">and even more!!</resource>
  <resource id="147.374">Along the way, Christina, Kevan, Eff, and I played the alphabet game like in a gazillion different versions.</resource>
  <resource id="147.375">It was totally killing my brain.</resource>
  <resource id="147.376">Two hours with Kevan, I should get credit for surviving that long with that nerd.</resource>
  <resource id="147.377">XD</resource>
  <resource id="147.378">Then we met him.</resource>
  <resource id="147.379">Eff questions how the belt keeps up his pants.</resource>
  <resource id="147.380">I question that too.</resource>
  <resource id="147.381">I want to go here.</resource>
  <resource id="147.382">because they have a snazzy sign!</resource>
  <resource id="147.383">Plus, SE7EN, the Korean singer is hot.</resource>
  <resource id="147.384">This was after we finished a 6 mile walk.</resource>
  <resource id="147.385">We were dead tired and so got some ice cream and fortune cookies to entertain ourselves.</resource>
  <resource id="147.386">Check out the look on Christina's face.</resource>
  <resource id="147.387">XD</resource>
  <resource id="147.388">Anywho, I got really interesting fortunes!</resource>
  <resource id="147.389">"Someone unexpected from your past with resurface."</resource>
  <resource id="147.390">[and guess what!</resource>
  <resource id="147.391">I saw Kathy Vu during the walk!</resource>
  <resource id="147.392">I haven't seen her in like two years!</resource>
  <resource id="147.393">Then, another someone unexpected too.]</resource>
  <resource id="147.394">Mr. Fortune Cookie, you are the bomb-diggity.</resource>
  <resource id="147.395">As for Eff, he got "You will find the road to happiness by helping others."</resource>
  <resource id="147.396">[how ironic is that, we were at the AIDS walk!]</resource>
  <resource id="147.397">XD Holy cow~</resource>
  <resource id="147.398">Eff likes bunnies.</resource>
  <resource id="147.399">Look at how stern his face is. XD</resource>
  <resource id="147.400">Afterwards, we went out to eat with other peoples at Pizza My Heart!</resource>
  <resource id="147.401">It was pretty good.</resource>
  <resource id="147.402">Check out "little dao's" face.</resource>
  <resource id="147.403">XD</resource>
  <resource id="147.404">and then meet "the nox".</resource>
  <resource id="147.405">Daos, you guys complete me. XDDDDDD</resource>
  <resource id="147.406">and to end the entry, I shall talk about Anthony who is totally weird.</resource>
  <resource id="147.407">XD</resource>
  <resource id="147.408">Our first conversation was an argument in English class.</resource>
  <resource id="147.409">:) I call him by his real name which he hates, Anthony.</resource>
  <resource id="147.410">Everyone else calls him Tony.</resource>
  <resource id="147.411">XD Yes people, he was baring a child, and then someone popped it.</resource>
  <resource id="147.412">XD</resource>
  <resource id="147.413">Anywho~ Today was fun.</resource>
  <resource id="147.414">I am going to do the AIDS walk again next year for fun.</resource>

  <resource id="149.428">Well here we are again at the conclusion of another all too fleeting weekend.</resource>
  <resource id="149.429">Although my brother likes to point out the fact that every day for me is a weekend.</resource>
  <resource id="149.430">Regardless of my temporal status as far as my brother is concerned, time still moves ahead at a frighteningly rapid pace.</resource>
  <resource id="149.431">Speaking of time, this morning amazon dot com and myself transacted some by business.</resource>
  <resource id="149.432">I ordered the first season of Doctor Who on DVD.</resource>
  <resource id="149.433">No, not the new first season, the William Hartnell black and white forty years ago suck it I'm the first Doctor first season.</resource>
  <resource id="149.434">I suddenly have the urge to own them all.</resource>
  <resource id="149.435">Once I have them all then I think I'll start on Blackadder.</resource>
  <resource id="149.436">I'm sorry but British television rules.</resource>
  <resource id="149.437">I spent the majority of the day up in Madison (hi Robby, I would have waved but I'm not sure where your house is).</resource>
  <resource id="149.438">Their historical society was having a century home tour as a fund raiser and my mother wanted to go.</resource>
  <resource id="149.439">I assumed that with my niece in New York and my sister working a weekend job to keep her there that it would just be my mother and I; little did I know that she invited my sister-in-law to accompany us.</resource>
  <resource id="149.440">Spending quality time with my sister-in-law is. different.</resource>
  <resource id="149.441">On the plus side, the home tour put me in the holiday spirit.</resource>
  <resource id="149.442">This week I am totally going to start my Christmas shopping.</resource>
  <resource id="149.443">I used to have it all done by Halloween so maybe I'll return to that tradition.</resource>
  <resource id="149.444">This coming week I intend to get serious about my real estate venture by establishing a revolving line of credit at the bank.</resource>
  <resource id="149.445">I am actively seeking foreclosures and other deals, however, if I find one I want to get the financing out of the way to allow me to move quickly.</resource>
  <resource id="149.446">It's not so much a matter of the early bird getting the worm as it is the procrastinating bird getting splattered by the semi out on I-90.</resource>

<block id="block 150">
  <resource id="150.448">Well, we're half-way through our trip.</resource>
  <resource id="150.449">I can't believe it!</resource>
  <resource id="150.450">We've seen so much.</resource>
  <resource id="150.451">It's amazing.</resource>
  <resource id="150.452">Right now we're on a train traveling from Rome to Florence.</resource>
  <resource id="150.453">We'll sightsee there and then take another train to Venice in the evening.</resource>
  <resource id="150.454">We're planning on staying two nights in Venice.</resource>
  <resource id="150.455">From there it's on to Switzerland and then France.</resource>
  <resource id="150.456">Anyway, Rome!</resource>
  <resource id="150.457">Wow.</resource>
  <resource id="150.458">We saw so much, I don't think I can remember it all.</resource>
  <resource id="150.459">On Friday we saw the Coliseum, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, Palatine Hill, Villa Medici, Trinita dei Monti, Piazza del Popolo and much more.</resource>
  <resource id="150.460">There is a church or ruins everywhere you look.</resource>
  <resource id="150.461">It is completely overwhelming.</resource>
  <resource id="150.462">The Coliseum (or Colosseo) was awesome.</resource>
  <resource id="150.463">That it is still standing for us to see is.  well, I feel very lucky.</resource>
  <resource id="150.464">Amazing.</resource>
  <resource id="150.465">Yesterday (Saturday) was spent at Vatican City.</resource>
  <resource id="150.466">To enter the Museums it was about a two hour wait.</resource>
  <resource id="150.467">The lines around the wall was insanely long.</resource>
  <resource id="150.468">In October the Museums close quite early (1:20pm), so by the time we got in we didn't have a whole lot of time to see things.</resource>
  <resource id="150.469">I would have loved to see the Library, but we didn't get to it.</resource>
  <resource id="150.470">Ah well.</resource>
  <resource id="150.471">So the rooms were breathtaking.</resource>
  <resource id="150.472">There was so much to look at, I just couldn't take it all in.</resource>
  <resource id="150.473">Honestly, by the time we got to the Sistine Chapel, and had walked through all these magnificent, opulent rooms, the Chapel didn't seem much different.</resource>
  <resource id="150.474">At all.</resource>
  <resource id="150.475">I realize it's the most famous because Michelangelo painted some of it, but it was a let down, I'll be honest.</resource>
  <resource id="150.476">After eating a quick meal we walked around the outside of the wall trying to find St. Peter's Basilica.</resource>
  <resource id="150.477">Things are NOT labeled well, let me tell you.</resource>
  <resource id="150.478">We walked around pretty much the entire city until we found it.</resource>
  <resource id="150.479">It was beautiful, and FULL of people and tour buses.</resource>
  <resource id="150.480">Again, we stood in line to enter the church.</resource>
  <resource id="150.481">Didn't have to wait too long, though.</resource>
  <resource id="150.482">Inside was stunning- and FULL of people.</resource>
  <resource id="150.483">The previous portion of the Vatican was worse, though.</resource>
  <resource id="150.484">And then we realized- there was Mass going on!</resource>
  <resource id="150.485">The church was full of tourists talking and snapping pictures, and there in the middle was the Pope or whoever just giving Mass. I suddenly felt like an ass.</resource>
  <resource id="150.486">I can't believe they do that!</resource>
  <resource id="150.487">It's so rude!</resource>
  <resource id="150.488">Still, it's nice that they all the public in at all.</resource>
  <resource id="150.489">We wanted to climb the Basilica, but, again no signs, so we had no idea where to go, and then we couldn't get back in.</resource>
  <resource id="150.490">Ah well.</resource>
  <resource id="150.491">Last night we met an Australian couple at our hostel and had a nice chat.</resource>
  <resource id="150.492">You meet a lot of neat people at hostels.</resource>
  <resource id="150.493">It's pretty cool.</resource>
  <resource id="150.494">So anyway, Rome in general was loud, dirty and absolutely chock-full of people and cars and bikes.</resource>
  <resource id="150.495">There is a pizzeria and gelateria on every corner.</resource>
  <resource id="150.496">The city really is like a human being, especially in the morning as you watch and hear it begin to awaken.</resource>
  <resource id="150.497">I think I'm still partial to the UK, perhaps because of the lack of language barrier, I don't know.</resource>
  <resource id="150.498">I've been trying not to think about my life back home, but sometimes it sneaks in, uninvited.</resource>
  <resource id="150.499">What the hell am I going to do when I get back home?</resource>
  <resource id="150.500">Should I take the job Jamie offered me? Should I stay in Salem?</resource>
  <resource id="150.501">These questions completely depress me.</resource>
  <resource id="150.502">Completely.</resource>

<block id="block 151">
  <resource id="151.503">so i've discovered a new superpowe (and yes i do have others).</resource>
  <resource id="151.504">i can dream and earthquake and it'll actually happen!!!</resource>
  <resource id="151.505">that's not entirely true.</resource>
  <resource id="151.506">what really happened was that an earthquake started and instead of waking up first i incorporated it into a dream where i was watching a documentary about earthquakes and they were "recounting" some classic earthquake showing how it would pulse stronger and stronger.</resource>
  <resource id="151.507">and then it finally got so strong i woke up and realized what was going on.</resource>
  <resource id="151.508">keep in mind my bed is lofted about 4.5 ft. high and i was hungover after having slept 4 hours.</resource>
  <resource id="151.509">i was very attentive, and it didn't seem like she was gonna break, so i just stayed there and eventually it stopped and i passed out again.</resource>
  <resource id="151.510">then my bro calls.</resource>
  <resource id="151.511">i'm too lazy to pick it up.</resource>
  <resource id="151.512">then he calls again and, knowing that's the international sign for "pick up the frickin' phone," i picked it up thinkin' there was something wrong with him.</resource>
  <resource id="151.513">and he's like.</resource>
  <resource id="151.514">are you okay?</resource>
  <resource id="151.515">i'm like.</resource>
  <resource id="151.516">huh, news travels fast.</resource>
  <resource id="151.517">his gf's mom had called him.</resource>
  <resource id="151.518">he called my sister.</resource>
  <resource id="151.519">THEY called me. i just wanted to frickin' sleep!</resource>
  <resource id="151.520">eitherw ay, finally got up for a while after talkin' to him and my sis and mom, listened to the radio for a little while (on my MP3 player 'cause the power was knocked out) and it was all fine.</resource>
  <resource id="151.521">so i went back to sleep 'till noon, took beau for a walk, surfed for four hours, cooked in the dark, read by candlelight for a little while, adn then the power came back on so i could watch tv.</resource>
  <resource id="151.522">all in all, an interesting sunday.</resource>
  <resource id="151.523">all my plans were shot to shit 'cause the cell waves were all packed and i couldn't get in touch with my friends very well.</resource>
  <resource id="151.524">and there was a storm at the same time so that didn't help.</resource>
  <resource id="151.525">yeah.</resource>
  <resource id="151.526">useless day.</resource>
  <resource id="151.527">then i needed a drink and naturally don't have beer, and i expected all the beer at the supermarket to be warm.</resource>
  <resource id="151.528">so i made a martini.</resource>
  <resource id="151.529">that i'm still trying to finish.</resource>
  <resource id="151.530">this fuckers don't go down too easy.</resource>
  <resource id="151.531">oh, earthquake was rated highest at a 6.6.</resource>
  <resource id="151.532">what surprised me most (geekin' it up) was the frequency of the rumbles.</resource>
  <resource id="151.533">i always excpected it to sound/feel like the ground shaking, up down rock cracking sorta thing.</resource>
  <resource id="151.534">but instead it was just a REALLY powerful.</resource>
  <resource id="151.535">hum.</resource>
  <resource id="151.536">definitely in the audible range and very regular.</resource>
  <resource id="151.537">the strength of it (amplitude) went up and down (up higher every time until the last one) and every time it did i'd be holding my breath wondering how bad it would get.</resource>
  <resource id="151.538">then it would relax again.</resource>
  <resource id="151.539">but yeah.</resource>
  <resource id="151.540">didn't rumble like.</resource>
  <resource id="151.541">say.</resource>
  <resource id="151.542">an avalanche (movie sounds) or rock slide.</resource>
  <resource id="151.543">or how they make them sound in movies.</resource>
  <resource id="151.544">it hummed.</resource>
  <resource id="151.545">the amount of energy required to move that much mass SUSTAINED at such a high frequency is ridiculous.</resource>
  <resource id="151.546">fun shit!</resource>

  <resource id="152.548">Earlier this week, Karina had invited me over to her townhouse.</resource>
  <resource id="152.549">She said that Kubik would be hanging out, and I could come if I wanted.</resource>
  <resource id="152.550">I got there a little after 7, Project Runway reruns playing on Bravo, and I asked, "Where's Kubik?" because she's usually very punctual.</resource>
  <resource id="152.551">I take a seat in the armchair across from Karina, and while she's talking, a face appears in the window behind her, grinning and waving enthusiastically.</resource>
  <resource id="152.552">I jump, shrieking a little before I realize it's only Kubik.</resource>
  <resource id="152.553">Kubik gets a plate for her Chipotle burrito, and I ask for tea to dilute the effects of the two cups of coffee I had earlier.</resource>
  <resource id="152.554">Karina prepared a plate of 3 cheeses, red peppers, crackers, and we settle in front of the TV for some Project Runway.</resource>
  <resource id="152.555">Original plan was to watch Brokeback Mountain, but I saw that 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate is on, and ask if we can watch that.</resource>
  <resource id="152.556">The two of them watch it, I half watch the movie while reading the newspaper, sometimes out loud, but Kubik complains, "SOMEONE IS TALKING while I'm trying to watch a movie!!" but Karina defends me, "You're one to talk."</resource>
  <resource id="152.557">The movie finishes a little after 11 pm, and Kubik would fan her face saying, "This is too intense.</resource>
  <resource id="152.558">This is too intense," with Karina asking if she needs to step outside.</resource>
  <resource id="152.559">We watch Project Runway, but the repetition of the same 5 commercials becomes old fast.</resource>
  <resource id="152.560">We think Jeffrey and his mowhawked girlfriend are weird.</resource>
  <resource id="152.561">Around 1 pm, Karina tells us that we need to leave because it's late.</resource>
  <resource id="152.562">Haha, except nicer.</resource>
  <resource id="152.563">Sometimes during the evening, Kubik or Karina would chant, "Harshy harshy, in the Marshy!"</resource>
  <resource id="152.564">Sunday afternoon, Erica, Diana, and I are going to the Spy Museum.</resource>
  <resource id="152.565">As I'm walking to the metro station, a teenage boy in his mixed group of 4 or 5 friends hanging outside yells, "I like your haircut!" and I answer, "Thanks," while I keep walking having seen Erica and Diana enter a little bit earlier.</resource>
  <resource id="152.566">A compliment from a trendy teenager can brighten up anyone's day.</resource>
  <resource id="152.567">The three of us find our way to the Spy Museum and I'm surprised by the number of young couples who are there, in addition to the usual elderly tourists and young families.</resource>
  <resource id="152.568">I'm the slowest to go through the exhibits, and I soon lose Erica and Diana, occasionally catching up with them when they slow down.</resource>
  <resource id="152.569">On the first floor, they have a crawlspace you can go through.</resource>
  <resource id="152.570">I don't see anyone going into it, and I hesitate, but curiosity wins out and I'm climbing on my hands and knees.</resource>
  <resource id="152.571">It's carpeted, so not too hard on the knees, and I see that someone left behind their brochure.</resource>
  <resource id="152.572">The fake vent opens to another part of the exhibit, and I get out.</resource>
  <resource id="152.573">While I'm looking at an exhibit on bugging devices, this kid comes up behind me and hands me the pamphlet, "You dropped this."</resource>
  <resource id="152.574">Later, there's a phone booth that rings for visitors to pick up, but our timing is never quite right.</resource>
  <resource id="152.575">We stop in the gift shop before heading home.</resource>
  <resource id="152.576">Diana finds a book, and Erica picks up some souvenirs for her family.</resource>
  <resource id="152.577">The wind blows strongly outside, and Diana has a hard time pushing open the door, but a 7 or 8 year old boy who's already exited with his family helps her out by pulling while she pushes.</resource>

<block id="block 153">
  <resource id="153.578">I woke up early and checked on my little Chirp.</resource>
  <resource id="153.579">She is looking well and seems comfy, so I tried to give her some water.</resource>
  <resource id="153.580">It was cute.</resource>
  <resource id="153.581">I dipped my finger into the water and she drank the water that collected on it when I put it close to her.</resource>
  <resource id="153.582">She is looking better than she did, but hasn't eaten anything, so I hope she continues to heal.</resource>
  <resource id="153.583">I had to fly out the door this morning and ended up being 10 minutes late for class, but we were doing a group project, so I dived in and did my part.</resource>
  <resource id="153.584">Josh a.k.a the creep, who I'm in the group with, has been tolerable.</resource>
  <resource id="153.585">I think he knows not to cross the line he crossed once before.</resource>
  <resource id="153.586">I joke with him as I usually do with people, so he's alright as long as he doesn't try anything stupid.</resource>
  <resource id="153.587">Nice guy, but was very dumb to try the crap he did.</resource>
  <resource id="153.588">So, we finished the group work and I decided just to head home.</resource>
  <resource id="153.589">There wasn't really nothing on campus I could do that I felt like doing.</resource>
  <resource id="153.590">I did spend some time on the Live Journal looking for pictures/ userpics.</resource>
  <resource id="153.591">I do love the Chun Li pictures I found.</resource>
  <resource id="153.592">She's always been one of my favorite video game characters.</resource>
  <resource id="153.593">maybe it's because she can beat the living shit out of guys heh.</resource>
  <resource id="153.594">Plus.</resource>
  <resource id="153.595">she's a character with a curvy figure and has a nice look to her.</resource>
  <resource id="153.596">I love her outfit as well, except I think the laughing after she wins a fight in street fighter is kind of silly, but that's just me. Kikyo, from the Inuyasha series, has been another favorite of mine.</resource>
  <resource id="153.597">I find myself relating to her alot.</resource>
  <resource id="153.598">I have a duty to myself and my family before I can become a normal woman.</resource>
  <resource id="153.599">have a true normal life.</resource>
  <resource id="153.600">LOL.</resource>
  <resource id="153.601">well as normal as it can be.</resource>
  <resource id="153.602">*whispers* especially if I factor Matt into the mix.</resource>
  <resource id="153.603">;) love u hun.</resource>
  <resource id="153.604">She is also very strong and keen, but carries the scars of her past.</resource>
  <resource id="153.605">Appleseed is another Anime movie I loved.</resource>
  <resource id="153.606">The remake and the character Deunan Knute just engaged me big time, so I had to include some pictures.</resource>
  <resource id="153.607">Deunan is a kickass character that all women should be proud of lol.</resource>
  <resource id="153.608">Wish I could get that ES.W.A.T uniform she wears.</resource>
  <resource id="153.609">Matt I actually think you may like this one.</resource>
  <resource id="153.610">So, that's what I did for like a half an hour.</resource>
  <resource id="153.611">Went home and finished the luncheon posters than I had to leave early for my eye appointment.</resource>
  <resource id="153.612">I found out my right eye got a little weaker, but other than that everything checked out fine.</resource>
  <resource id="153.613">I decided to get my annual supply of contacts with the knowledge if I did I could get a free webcam and a $30 rebate.</resource>
  <resource id="153.614">The total came to $218.92, but it's worth it.</resource>
  <resource id="153.615">I still have a few other appointments.</resource>
  <resource id="153.616">medical and dental, but I definetly need my loan to secure all my funds.</resource>
  <resource id="153.617">I than went to Office Max and got two jump drives.</resource>
  <resource id="153.618">They were on a special and heh.</resource>
  <resource id="153.619">I think the cashier made a mistake, but I didn't say anything.</resource>
  <resource id="153.620">I believe she entered in $17.88, instead of $18.88, so I got an unexpected discount.</resource>
  <resource id="153.621">It's a SanDisk Micro 1.0 GB jump drive, so not a bad deal.</resource>
  <resource id="153.622">Worked out at the YMCA and took a long relaxing shower after a stay in the sauna.</resource>
  <resource id="153.623">It feels so nice after a long workout.</resource>
  <resource id="153.624">So, I stayed at the YMCA for about 2 hours and went home to my little bird.</resource>
  <resource id="153.625">She was doing better and was more spunky:).</resource>
  <resource id="153.626">I took out the webcam from Shopko and entered the program into my computer.</resource>
  <resource id="153.627">It works great and I really like it.</resource>
  <resource id="153.628">I couldn't wait for Matt to see me again.</resource>
  <resource id="153.629">It's actually something I thought about alot and I did stay dressed up for it.</resource>
  <resource id="153.630">I mean.</resource>
  <resource id="153.631">my guy hasn't seen me for about 4 months, so I wanted to look nice.</resource>
  <resource id="153.632">I've always been able to see him if I asked, so now he has the option now as well.</resource>
  <resource id="153.633">*smiles* he said I looked cute as always.</resource>
  <resource id="153.634">thanks hun.</resource>
  <resource id="153.635">However, I know I'm letting the stress get to me. Hun.</resource>
  <resource id="153.636">I'm sorry and I will get more focused.</resource>
  <resource id="153.637">I've not been acting like myself and I know it.</resource>
  <resource id="153.638">and don't like it at all.</resource>
  <resource id="153.639">So, I dedicate this song to you.</resource>
  <resource id="153.640">Artist: Crossfade</resource>
  <resource id="153.641">Song: Cold</resource>
  <resource id="153.642">Looking back at me I see</resource>
  <resource id="153.643">That I never really got it right</resource>
  <resource id="153.644">I never stopped to think of you</resource>
  <resource id="153.645">I'm always wrapped up in</resource>
  <resource id="153.646">Things I cannnot win</resource>
  <resource id="153.647">You are the antidote that gets me by</resource>
  <resource id="153.648">Something strong</resource>
  <resource id="153.649">Like a drug that gets me high</resource>
  <resource id="153.650">What I really meant to say</resource>
  <resource id="153.651">Is I'm sorry for the way I am</resource>
  <resource id="153.652">I never meant to be so cold to you</resource>
  <resource id="153.653">And I'm sorry about all the lies</resource>
  <resource id="153.654">Maybe in a different light</resource>
  <resource id="153.655">You could see me stand on my own again</resource>
  <resource id="153.656">Cause now i can see</resource>
  <resource id="153.657">You were the antidote that got me by</resource>
  <resource id="153.658">Something strong like a drug that got me high</resource>
  <resource id="153.659">I never meant to be so cold</resource>

  <resource id="153.661">The screwed up side of me that I keep</resource>
  <resource id="153.662">Locked inside of me so deep</resource>
  <resource id="153.663">It always seems to get to me</resource>
  <resource id="153.664">I never really wanted you to go</resource>
  <resource id="153.665">So many things you should have known</resource>
  <resource id="153.666">I guess for me theres just no hope</resource>
  <resource id="153.667">I never meant to be so cold</resource>

  <resource id="154.670">Mrangelmeg and I took his cousin Lilli to St Meinrad with us on Friday evening for a couple of functions that happened to be going on that evening in conjunction with this semester's lay student class weekend.</resource>
  <resource id="154.671">As I have said before I am happily not taking a class this semester, but these two particular functions were ones that were not to be missed.</resource>
  <resource id="154.672">The first was the dedication of a painting that was donated to the school by the students of Fr Damien Dietlein OSB, the Old Testament Professor there.</resource>
  <resource id="154.673">The picture is called Exodus and is of Moses and the Israelites crossing the Red Sea, painted by an Ethiopian artist who currently lives in South Dakota.</resource>
  <resource id="154.674">The entire enterprise was done as a surprise to Damo (our name for Father) and he was genuinely touched and surprised by the affair.</resource>
  <resource id="154.675">The other activity was the inaugural session of Theology in the Round, a session intended to bring Seminarians, Lay Students and Alumni together for an evening of discussion surrounding a topic chosen by a guest speaker.</resource>
  <resource id="154.676">The evening's speaker happened to be another of my professors: Fr.</resource>
  <resource id="154.677">Denis Robinson OSB whom I had for Early Church History and had been telling mrangelmeg about for months.</resource>
  <resource id="154.678">His topic was John Henry Newman and Catholic Education.</resource>
  <resource id="154.679">It was a bit more lecture than discussion, but very interesting none-the-less.</resource>
  <resource id="154.680">I really wanted mrangelmeg to have a chance to experience Fr.</resource>
  <resource id="154.681">Denis because he is a force with which to be reckoned.</resource>
  <resource id="154.682">After that discussion we spent some time in the little bar on campus which is called the Unstable ( Benedictines take a vow of stability, so they call the bar, the Unstable, get it?)</resource>
  <resource id="154.683">visiting with all my friends who are there for class this weekend while I am not.</resource>
  <resource id="154.684">I do miss them so very much, though I don't miss class at all.</resource>
  <resource id="154.685">I even had a chance to talk to the artist of the painting, which was really cool, they flew him in for the unveiling, but his plane was delayed and he didn't get there till later, but he was going to be there for the weekend.</resource>
  <resource id="154.686">We had a wonderful time.</resource>
  <resource id="154.687">And we got to see the Extreme Makeover Home Edition house in St. Meinrad (the town) as we drove to the Monastery.</resource>
  <resource id="154.688">How cool was that?</resource>
  <resource id="154.689">I have to admit, knowing that those of my friends who were there for Fr.</resource>
  <resource id="154.690">Denis' class on Creed were having a quiz on Heresies in the early church on Saturday morning I was more than happy to be returning home Friday night.</resource>

  <resource id="155.700">Classical Music 101</resource>
  <resource id="155.701">Welcome to the world of classical music.</resource>
  <resource id="155.702">It's my world, a place where music in endless forms and varieties give me an entire lifetime of listening pleasure.</resource>
  <resource id="155.703">It's the oldest recognized type of music in Western civilization, and it dates back well into the Middle Ages.</resource>
  <resource id="155.704">Since classical music is the oldest and largest genre of music in existence, let's study this music from one era to the next.</resource>
  <resource id="155.705">Most music historians identify anywhere from four to seven distinct eras in classical music, and since I recognize all seven, let's learn about each one:</resource>
  <resource id="155.706">1.</resource>
  <resource id="155.707">Middle Ages (450 A.D. to 1450 A.D): Shortly after the fall of the Roman Empire, the first era of classical music was born.</resource>
  <resource id="155.708">Our first composers were mostly supported by the church (surprise!), and religion influenced early classical music more than any other source.</resource>
  <resource id="155.709">There was no formal system of notation, making composing very difficult and time-consuming.</resource>
  <resource id="155.710">Gregorian chants were written during these ancient times.</resource>
  <resource id="155.711">2.</resource>
  <resource id="155.712">Renaissance (1450 - 1600): Humans discovered that Earth is not the center of the universe, so classical music changed along with the rest of the arts.</resource>
  <resource id="155.713">Music became more of an expressive art than a science, and music was now being printed, allowing sacred, secular, and instrumental music to spread everywhere.</resource>
  <resource id="155.714">Governments now influenced the spread of the era's music more than the church.</resource>
  <resource id="155.715">Claudio Montiverdi was one of the most prominent composers of this era.</resource>
  <resource id="155.716">3.</resource>
  <resource id="155.717">Baroque (1600-1750): The era of Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi saw the development of almost every modern instrument in use today, particularly the violin, clarinet, and piano.</resource>
  <resource id="155.718">Composers developed the idea of the sonata, the concerto, and the symphony, where great performers (called virtuosos) found enormous success.</resource>
  <resource id="155.719">Composers used counterpoint, dance rhythms and repetition in their music.</resource>
  <resource id="155.720">4.</resource>
  <resource id="155.721">Classical (1750-1825): Yes, this era just happens to have the same name as the whole genre that we're studying, yet it has the shortest time span of any classical music period.</resource>
  <resource id="155.722">Think of this brief period as a launch platform of all the modern music to follow.</resource>
  <resource id="155.723">If you speak to a music snob who claims that this is the only "real" era of classical, then politely extend your middle finger while mooning the person.</resource>
  <resource id="155.724">Just kidding.</resource>
  <resource id="155.725">Anyway, classical music wasn't even called classical music back in this time.</resource>
  <resource id="155.726">You can find nearly all of the most popular composers in this era, namely Mozart and Beethoven (both of whom didn't know they were writing "classical").</resource>
  <resource id="155.727">It's pretty funny if you think about it.</resource>
  <resource id="155.728">They used simple ideas, simple textures, and simple forms, all of which make for great listening material.</resource>
  <resource id="155.729">5.</resource>
  <resource id="155.730">Romantic (1825-1900): Lush and beautiful music was the prevailing theme during most of the 1800s, and music was written to tell stories, to depict the mysteries of nature, or to express the upper reaches of human emotions.</resource>
  <resource id="155.731">Composers of this era such as Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and Chopin wrote music with a wider dynamic range, using a larger variety of instruments.</resource>
  <resource id="155.732">Their melodies were longer and more dramatic, and their harmonies were fuller, richer, and more dissonant.</resource>
  <resource id="155.733">Female composers gained more visibility during this period, such as Clara Schumann.</resource>
  <resource id="155.734">6.</resource>
  <resource id="155.735">20th Century: 1900-1999: Classical music exploded, evolved and splintered faster than it ever had before.</resource>
  <resource id="155.736">New subcategories of classical music were born every year, and more composers were writing music than all previous eras combined.</resource>
  <resource id="155.737">Music of this era was influenced by anything and everything, including world wars, politics, SEX, and cross-pollination by other types of music such as jazz.</resource>
  <resource id="155.738">And anything and everything was possible, from atonal to experimental to electronic.</resource>
  <resource id="155.739">Finally, music could be recorded and distributed widely, creating a burgeoning market for all types of new music.</resource>
  <resource id="155.740">Over one hundred thousand composers fall into this period, including Copland, Stravinsky, and Ravel.</resource>
  <resource id="155.741">Needless to say, neither the church nor the government contributed much to classical music in this century.</resource>
  <resource id="155.742">7.</resource>
  <resource id="155.743">Contemporary Classical: 1970 - 2050 (projected): If the 20th Century period ends in 1999, then what do we call all classical music written thereafter?</resource>
  <resource id="155.744">Welcome to the contemporary classical period, where we see even more subcategories such as the minimalism of Philip Glass, the electric opera by John Corigliano, and the twelve-tone works of John Bilotta, a Bay Area composer!</resource>
  <resource id="155.745">The few creative barriers that may have been left after the 20th century have been crushed by a whopping 300,000 living composers, and this contemporary period gives new meaning to the phrase "Anything Goes!"</resource>
  <resource id="155.746">That was painless, wasn't it?</resource>
  <resource id="155.747">There is so much more to learn, but this is your first step into removing the mystery from these vast eras.</resource>

  <resource id="156.752">Measure 40 amends the state constitution to require supreme court and appeals judges to be elected by district instead of the statewide vote that currently happens.</resource>
  <resource id="156.753">Arguments in favor: 29</resource>
  <resource id="156.754">Arguments in opposition: 20</resource>
  <resource id="156.755">8 of the "pro" arguments consist of someone listing what I take to be every single county in Oregon from which there are no appellate judges.</resource>
  <resource id="156.756">Both sides have a mixture of more polemic arguments and more reasonable arguments.</resource>
  <resource id="156.757">There's all kinds of thought about how the measure will make judicial positions more or less political, whether those positions already are political, whether it matters that the Oregon constitution originally had district elections and switched to statewide some time ago, whether elections by district mean that some of the judges will be less qualified than others could have been or whether it means that currently underrepresented areas (think every rural area) will have a better chance to have someone who understands them in the appellate courts, etc.</resource>
  <resource id="156.758">All in all, most of the arguments are not very convincing one way or the other.</resource>
  <resource id="156.759">One of the few that seemed to me to say something worth saying was an argument in favor that was written by Ron Saxton.</resource>
  <resource id="156.760">This surprised me, because I know from TV ads that Ron Saxton is running for something or other.</resource>
  <resource id="156.761">As such I consider him to be primarily a politician, and it is rare that I find what I might consider words of wisdom from a politician, even when I agree with them.</resource>
  <resource id="156.762">The one other somewhat-convincing argument was immediately after that one, also in favor, by an organization of Oregon farmers.</resource>
  <resource id="156.763">They talked about how it would be nice if some of the appellate judges understood how farms operate when lawsuits against farmers come up.</resource>
  <resource id="156.764">There seemed to be at least a smidgen of personal experience reflected in that argument, something not really present anywhere else.</resource>
  <resource id="156.765">So I'm leaning slightly in favor, although I mostly don't see how it will make that big of a difference.</resource>

  <resource id="170.6">I love the show because I learn so much.</resource>
  <resource id="170.7">Many times, I'll hear commentators, and sometimes I'll even agree with them.</resource>
  <resource id="170.8">I love your reports on sustainability, by the way.</resource>
  <resource id="170.9">Today, though, I heard the commentary of Susan Lee.</resource>
  <resource id="170.10">I have issues with a lot of what she not only proposes, but assumes.</resource>
  <resource id="170.11">Assumption: "That's because Markets[sic] are much better at collecting and evaluating information than anything else on the planet."</resource>
  <resource id="170.12">This depends on what you're measuring.</resource>
  <resource id="170.13">Markets do not measure everything accurately, and I find this assumption to be disgusting.</resource>
  <resource id="170.14">Markets fail all the time in measuring things of value: labour, love, music/art, life, environment, pollution.</resource>
  <resource id="170.15">all of these things fail in the marketplace in some ways.</resource>
  <resource id="170.16">Biodiversity isn't measured because it is more complex than one transaction.</resource>
  <resource id="170.17">systems thinking fails in market mentality.</resource>
  <resource id="170.18">I'm worth much more than I'm paid, for example.</resource>
  <resource id="170.19">And the Walmartisation of the world changes markets for the worse for labour, making people a mere slot in a computerised schedule, with no regard for their free time.</resource>
  <resource id="170.20">Forcing the world into markets is exactly what creates so many problems in the world (*ahem* people are at war with us over it, you know).</resource>
  <resource id="170.21">One dimensional indicators (the dollar) of a myriad of factors is neither safe nor sane.</resource>
  <resource id="170.22">The dollar doesn't measure the pleasure I get when the sun strikes my plants, flowers, or radishes.</resource>
  <resource id="170.23">The dollar doesn't measure love.</resource>
  <resource id="170.24">The dollar doesn't measure the joy of playing music (if it did, I'd make more money doing it!).</resource>
  <resource id="170.25">It is dangerous to force everything into a market mentality.</resource>
  <resource id="170.26">It is like throwing everything you eat into a meat grinder.</resource>

  <resource id="170.35">Let's not promote gambling the security and livelihoods of people just because they're a few thousand miles away or brown.</resource>
  <resource id="170.36">How disgusting would it be to see 9/11 turn into a 'market'?</resource>
  <resource id="170.37">And who would be the bastard who profits off of the destruction of my workplace and life?</resource>
  <resource id="170.38">I guarantee, there would be a price on that person's head by my friends and family (probably not set very high, though, they're not rich capitalists).</resource>
  <resource id="170.39">And, I do ask, who profited from 9/11 in the first place?</resource>
  <resource id="170.40">Yes, Ms Lee mentions insurance.</resource>
  <resource id="170.41">Look into it.</resource>
  <resource id="170.42">The answers are dispicable.</resource>
  <resource id="170.43">Comment: "Traders, those who buy and sell the contracts, bring all their disparate information on the political situation in Saudi Arabia into this central marketplace.</resource>
  <resource id="170.44">Their bets on the probability of this one terrorist action would be reflected in the price of the contract."</resource>
  <resource id="170.45">I find it funny that 'traitor' and 'trader' are pronounced the same in American English.</resource>
  <resource id="170.46">Would Ms Lee be throwing out these ideas for the US elections?</resource>
  <resource id="170.47">Talk about room for controversy and conspiracy theories!</resource>
  <resource id="170.48">Plus, in such a secretive government, wouldn't this promote corruption?</resource>

  <resource id="171.66">Here's another great case of Redcoat Logic.</resource>
  <resource id="171.67">Joementum manages to dive on the recent threat-ish that emerged from Britain and turn it all around to make a comment on Ned and the democrats.</resource>
  <resource id="171.68">"If we just pick up like Ned Lamont wants us to do, get out by a date certain, it will be taken as a tremendous victory by the same people who wanted to blow up these planes in this plot hatched in England," Mr. Lieberman said at a campaign event in Waterbury, Conn. "It will strengthen them, and they will strike again."</resource>
  <resource id="171.69"> uh-huh.</resource>
  <resource id="171.70">Apparently the extremist terrorists in Britain are connected to the insurgents in Iraq (despite the fact that the former were pure terrorists and the latter are involved in a civil war), and that a slow exit from Iraq was their goal.</resource>
  <resource id="171.71">That's why they went for the British airports.</resource>
  <resource id="171.72">Does no one see the problem with that logic?</resource>
  <resource id="171.73">This is how the redcoats see the world.</resource>
  <resource id="171.74">The war in Iraq is fighting terrorists.</resource>
  <resource id="171.75">Terrorists are all one giant unit.</resource>
  <resource id="171.76">The terrorists want us out of Iraq.</resource>
  <resource id="171.77">As long as terrorists exist, we can't get out of Iraq.</resource>
  <resource id="171.78">As long as there are any terrorists anywhere doing anything, we can't pull out.</resource>
  <resource id="171.79">I want to point out that the Iraqis themselves are never mentioned with this ridiculous argument.</resource>
  <resource id="171.80">The state of Iraq, what the Iraqi people want, all of that jazz, it's never spoken of at times like these.</resource>
  <resource id="171.81">All that matters is that terrorists want us out of Iraq, so that means we have to stay.</resource>
  <resource id="171.82">I'd also like to point out that the liberal complaint is not that we're fighting terrorists, it's that we're NOT fighting terrorists.</resource>
  <resource id="171.83">We were fighting terrorists in Afghanistan (sort of, we were fighting extremists in Afghanistan while the country that spawned them, Saudi Arabia, got our money).</resource>
  <resource id="171.84">The complaint is that we abandoned the search for bin Laden in Afghanistan and went into Iraq under incredibly false premises.</resource>
  <resource id="171.85">Then Holy Joe ripped this one out:</resource>
  <resource id="171.86">"I'm worried that too many people, both in politics and out, don't appreciate the seriousness of the threat to American security and the evil of the enemy that faces us," Mr. Lieberman said at the Waterbury event.</resource>
  <resource id="171.87">He called that threat "more evil, or as evil, as Nazism and probably more dangerous than the Soviet Communists we fought during the long cold war."</resource>
  <resource id="171.88">The Stalin-led USSR and Nazis led to, roughly, a combined 20,000,000 dead bodies and millions more affected by losing their homes and other repression.</resource>
  <resource id="171.89">To suggest that a couple of disorganized idiots trying to replicate Yousef's 1995 plot is more evil and more dangerous than what they did is beyond off-base, beyond stupid.</resource>
  <resource id="171.90">It's flat-out disgusting.</resource>
  <resource id="171.91">Joe, you're scraping.</resource>
  <resource id="171.92">You're losing your goddamn mind.</resource>
  <resource id="171.93">You're turning redcoat.</resource>

  <resource id="172.94">Another apocalyptic vision last night: wandering through large rooms that are stuffy and crowded with people lying on the floor covered with sheets, most of them separate from each other.</resource>
  <resource id="172.95">Some aggressive people with mean faces and nasty attitudes staking out their turf, telling us to move along.</resource>
  <resource id="172.96">We try to find comfortable space and head down a winding staircase that seems to get smaller as it gets to the bottom.</resource>
  <resource id="172.97">Then I am outside and they are calling the name D'Angelo for people to board rescue vehicles.</resource>
  <resource id="172.98">A large woman who identifies herself as Sabrina but who looks like Shelley Winters from the original Poseidon Adventure movie is attacked and stung to death by killer bees.</resource>

  <resource id="172.100">I join a line of people with unpleasant faces who are carrying suitcases and moving along.</resource>
  <resource id="172.101">Then I wake up.</resource>
</block>

<block id="block 173">
  <resource id="173.102">I am, by no means, an art critic.</resource>
  <resource id="173.103">I know very little about art, save the few well-known artists that everyone knows.</resource>
  <resource id="173.104">For my birthday, Jon took me to the Getty Center in Los Angeles.</resource>
  <resource id="173.105">For those who don't know, Jean Paul Getty was a big-time oil tycoon here in California who, like a lot of people with insane amounts of money, started buying a lot of art.</resource>
  <resource id="173.106">The Getty Museum in LA stems from his collection.</resource>
  <resource id="173.107">The Getty is this huge, beautiful architectual wonder that sits on the top of a hill that overlooks Westwood and downtown LA. They have everything from Greek statues to modern photography exhibits.</resource>
  <resource id="173.108">They have several Degas.</resource>
  <resource id="173.109">and Rembrants.</resource>
  <resource id="173.110">and Monets.</resource>
  <resource id="173.111">and Reniors.</resource>
  <resource id="173.112">and Titians.</resource>
  <resource id="173.113">and Van Goghs.</resource>
  <resource id="173.114">Now, understand, when it comes right down to it, I am a hick from the sticks.</resource>
  <resource id="173.115">The only "art" I have ever been exposed to is the stuff that pretentious college drop-outs create and try to sell by hanging it on the walls for coffee shops.</resource>
  <resource id="173.116">I had never before seen a work by any of the Masters - the closest I have ever gotten to a Michelangelo is watching "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles".</resource>
  <resource id="173.117">It's easy to Google Image search "Monet" and look at the results, but pictures and posters hold no candle to the real deal.</resource>
  <resource id="173.118">I cried (yes, tears streaming down the face like a big dork) when I saw Rembrant's "Old Man in a Military Costume."</resource>
  <resource id="173.119">I cried again in the Impressionists Gallery.</resource>
  <resource id="173.120">I was so amazed by the brush strokes, the colors, the view up close and stepping back.</resource>
  <resource id="173.121">I saw a real Bouguereau.</resource>
  <resource id="173.122">A real Alma-Tadema.</resource>
  <resource id="173.123">And all I could do was blubber like a sap at the beauty.</resource>
  <resource id="173.124">Oh, and I think I made the security guards really nervous - like I was going to blow my runny nose on the Renoir and forever ruin it with my bodily fluids.</resource>
  <resource id="173.125">They didn't like me very much.</resource>
  <resource id="173.126">Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting</resource>
  <resource id="173.127">(Pretty, no? You should see it in person!)</resource>
  <resource id="173.128">So, I'm sure you're asking, "What on earth is this crazy broad getting at?!</resource>
  <resource id="173.129">We already know she's a big doofus - tell us something we didn't know!"</resource>
  <resource id="173.130">Well, I'm getting to that!</resource>
  <resource id="173.131">Like I said, I'm no judge of art.</resource>
  <resource id="173.132">Back in June, Jon and I made a quick spur-of-the-moment trip to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.</resource>
  <resource id="173.133">The purpose - to catch Body Worlds 2 while we could (the exhibit had already come and gone to LA, so this was the only chance we would get.)</resource>
  <resource id="173.134">I was excited to see it as I have a fondness of cadavers (blame Gross Anatomy) and really wanted to get another shot at some up close anatomy viewing.</resource>
  <resource id="173.135">Luckily for me, Jon is great about indulging my whims.</resource>
  <resource id="173.136">Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting</resource>
  <resource id="173.137">Even though I had gotten tickets online and reserved our place, the wait was long.</resource>
  <resource id="173.138">The exhibit itself was packed - they were at capacity at all times, and moving along the initial cases of bones and joints became tiresome (my response to the situation was to tell Jon to take all the time he liked to view things, while I moved more quickly through things - "yeah, a femur.</resource>
  <resource id="173.139">Another femur.</resource>
  <resource id="173.140">A femoralacetabular joint.</resource>
  <resource id="173.141">A glenoid-humoral joint.") Some of the exhibits were very interesting, such as  the soccer player and the skateboarder.</resource>
  <resource id="173.142">In Gross Anatomy, our cadavers were solemn - laying on the tables as if in a deep slumber.</resource>
  <resource id="173.143">Seeing the body in action was very interesting.</resource>
  <resource id="173.144">Also interesting were the cases of organs - healthy and diseased.</resource>
  <resource id="173.145">However, the entire exhibit wasn't as cut and dry (excuse the horrible pun.)</resource>
  <resource id="173.146">The odd thing about Body Worlds is that it goes from being an anatomy exhibit to being a sort of Cadaver Carnival of Bizarre Art.</resource>
  <resource id="173.147">The cadavers are flayed open in weird completely un-anatomical positions, or skinned (yes, horrible word, but it's one we actually use in lab) in such a way that the grotesque imagery overshadows the actual anatomy.</resource>
  <resource id="173.148">(I can't find any good images of the weird displays, so to view some you have to look here at the International Body Worlds Online Store.)</resource>
  <resource id="173.149">Again, I am no judge of art, and the fact that this exhibit has drawn record numbers of people hint at the possibility that I am off-base.</resource>
  <resource id="173.150">Body Worlds is great in that it gives everyday people the chance to look at the machinery that is the body.</resource>
  <resource id="173.151">Now, people can see that organs are not the cartoonish objects that one sees in a book.</resource>
  <resource id="173.152">The general public also has a chance to look at diseased organs (something usually reserved for pathologists, who, I've noticed, seem to get *very* excited over things like polyps and necrosis.)</resource>
  <resource id="173.153">They have the blood vessels of various limbs that have been injected with polymers so that you can witness the intricacies of the blood supply.</resource>
  <resource id="173.154">The basic anatomy and bodies in motion portions are a must see.</resource>
  <resource id="173.155">However, for me, the more "artistic" exhibits were more of a turn off - I willingly admit that I was very attached to my cadaver in Gross, and the thought of him being displayed like that makes me a bit sick.</resource>
  <resource id="173.156">Body Worlds is both fascinating and repelling.</resource>
  <resource id="173.157">Then again, I'm not a good judge of art.</resource>
  <resource id="173.158">As an aside, there have been some interesting articles regarding the aquisition of cadavers for exhibits such as Body Worlds (I guess the entire affair has sparked various "knock-off" exhibits!)</resource>
  <resource id="173.159">Due to increased demand for bodies, China has stepped into the body buisness.</resource>
  <resource id="173.160">While this country has access to huge numbers of scientists and medical students (someone has to do the dirty work) there have been some controversies, and questions as to where the cadavers come from.</resource>
  <resource id="173.161">The creator of "Body Worlds" has denied that his specimines have been acquired in any dubious manner, and has documentation to that effect.</resource>
  <resource id="173.162">However, some of the knock-offs might not be as professional (personally, I'd avoid them if I were you.)</resource>
  <resource id="173.163">I won't make any more comments about it, and leave it in your hands.</resource>

  <resource id="175.176">I say yes because it's such a juicy secret not to know!</resource>
  <resource id="175.177">I also think it'll be another way to help us bond with the baby by deciding on names and feeling like we're talking to 'Johnny (just a name.</resource>

  <resource id="176.182">Now I am alone in the great room and using the master computer, which is about as slow as a gym class for special kids.</resource>
  <resource id="176.183">This afternoon, I went shopping for school supplies.</resource>
  <resource id="176.184">Summer has gotten to me, and now it needs to leave.</resource>
  <resource id="176.185">It hasn't been very eventful in any way.</resource>
  <resource id="176.186">The most exciting time of my whole summer was going to Virginia with the Patricks, Pearsons and Roths, and that lasted less than a week.</resource>
  <resource id="176.187">Tomorrow, I hope either my mother or father takes me to go buy school clothes.</resource>
  <resource id="176.188">I don't except them to, because my Dad is taking my brother golfing (as previously stated), and my mother hates the mall more than she hates anything else.</resource>

  <resource id="176.190">or George Bush.</resource>

  <resource id="176.202">It looks like somebody puked up several golds and pinks, and then pasted it on a canvas.</resource>
  <resource id="176.203">My cat, Roxie, is very nervous.</resource>

  <resource id="177.209">what i hate even more is when i used to get into those moods i used to just go running and now i cant do even that cuz i start to hurt and then i get even more pissed off/sad.</resource>
  <resource id="177.210">i just want.</resource>
  <resource id="177.211">i dont even know.</resource>
  <resource id="177.212">i mean i know but i cant put it into words and i just dont want to say it i guess.</resource>
  <resource id="177.213">anyways school has started and i have all the classes i wanted except i got psyc instead of swimming and i hope i can switch into swimming cuz i already took psyc at BCC and it would be pointless but CC is in swim class and if i switch tasia will get mad at me but if i dont switch then mo will get mad at me and it would be kinda pointless and i want to kinda do both cuz psyc seems kinda fun but swimming does too and i dont want anyone to get mad at me. and it sucks.</resource>
  <resource id="177.214">and im not trying to be mean but if i say i dislike someone and you are like "why why why" and i try to explain but you're just like "thats stupid you shouldnt dislike her" it pisses me off if i have to defend myself for disliking someone.</resource>
  <resource id="177.215">and that's one of the only people i highly dislike.</resource>
  <resource id="177.216">actually thats the only person i highly dislike.</resource>
  <resource id="177.217">i mean i have my reason to dislike someone and you shouldnt question them cuz you arent me and you dont know and just stop.</resource>

  <resource id="178.227">Then I guess my head slammed into the window behind me and I fell on the floor.</resource>
  <resource id="178.228">I woke up to Jon picking up my head and saying my name, but I couldn't hear him.</resource>
  <resource id="178.229">It's because of thing called "vasovagal syncope" and was triggered because I have a kidney infection that was making me dehydrated and nauseous.</resource>
  <resource id="178.230">That's also why I passed out last summer.</resource>

  <resource id="180.255">Anyway, as the day proceeded it seemed to be getting easier, and I was so sure I had the basics down pat.</resource>
  <resource id="180.256">I felt this way up until it was time to count my drawer.</resource>
  <resource id="180.257">Turns out my drawer was seven dollars short &gt;.&lt; My boss got really upset, which than of course made me feel horrible, not to mention embarrassed.</resource>
  <resource id="180.258">After that I had pretty much decided that it was giving up time.</resource>
  <resource id="180.259">Than Tricia, my boss called me when I got home that night and apologized to me for everything.</resource>
  <resource id="180.260">I guess that made me feel a little bit more at ease.</resource>
  <resource id="180.261">The second day I went in and I was so paranoid.</resource>
  <resource id="180.262">OF course I was stressing it too much because as the day proceeded, I began to feel myself becoming more and more comfortable with everything.</resource>
  <resource id="180.263">The end of the day came and it was than time to count out my drawer.</resource>
  <resource id="180.264">My change was exact down to the last penny, what a relief that was for me lol.</resource>
  <resource id="180.265">Today (day three) went relatively smoothe.</resource>
  <resource id="180.266">It was actually quite busy this morning, soo many balloon orders &gt;.&lt; (oh how I dislike those) I hadn't gotten much sleep the night before so the day seemed to drag out that much more lol.</resource>
  <resource id="180.267">But it was wasn't so bad since I got to hang out with Lauren the night before :]To make this somewhat shorter.</resource>
  <resource id="180.268">at the end of today my drawer was exact again.</resource>
  <resource id="180.269">My charges were.50 short, but apparently that's not a horrible thing.</resource>

<block id="block 181">
  <resource id="181.277">Another little check-off on the to-do list, as all three of my summer classes are now done and graded, and I still retain my 4.0 GPA.</resource>
  <resource id="181.278">It's a bit more satisfying this time than most since I'm now past the second of the three major problem classes I identified when I first got back into school.</resource>
  <resource id="181.279">I assume until proven otherwise that I ought to be able to excel at the highest level at most things, so a top grade in all of my classes was always the goal from day 1.</resource>
  <resource id="181.280">However, there are several things I know full well I've been between mediocre and bad at in the past- theoretical math, foreign languages, public speaking.</resource>
  <resource id="181.281">Thus, Statistics, mandatory Spanish, and the public speaking class I've been in this summer were the three classes I've assumed were most likely to potentially drop my GPA.</resource>
  <resource id="181.282">So far that's turned out to be little problem- I believe I got perhaps 4 questions wrong over 5 or 6 tests in all of stats and secured an A easily in Speech.</resource>
  <resource id="181.283">What's more, I could tell the subjects themselves were coming to me much easier than they did, say, 5 years ago- so it wasn't simply a matter of more lax evaluation.</resource>
  <resource id="181.284">My mind seems to follow the theoretical math easier, and the crippling anxiety which used to accompany public performance is essentially gone; three cheers for not being depressed.</resource>
  <resource id="181.285">None of this is really an achievement of course, but it is nice to know that I seem to be improving in areas which were previously more difficult.</resource>
  <resource id="181.286">I dislike the idea of having gaps in my ability; it's the same need for balance that leads to me trying to further develop my natural cross-handedness into ambidexterity.</resource>
  <resource id="181.287">It's why I try to hone my body as I do my mind.</resource>
  <resource id="181.288">I've always been aware that I excelled verbally at potentially the highest level, and so I was best served by following and developing that side of my talents; but I refuse to allow that pursuit and development to leave me lopsided or with deficiencies in other areas.</resource>

  <resource id="182.299">I wonder if its faded, yet.</resource>
  <resource id="182.300">He called me a woman.</resource>
  <resource id="182.301">I don't look that much like a girl, do I?</resource>
</block>

<block id="block 183">
  <resource id="183.302">It's good that I'm old enough to learn lessons on my own and not from others, either by teaching or example, because people are stupid.</resource>
  <resource id="183.303">Seven hours on the road in two days, and I've come to the conclusion that most people have no concept of what turn signals, speed limits, and restroom sinks are for.</resource>
  <resource id="183.304">I stopped in New Gloucester to use the bathroom on the turnpike, and had to wait because it was so busy.</resource>
  <resource id="183.305">I saw one guy after another take a piss then leave without washing his hands.</resource>
  <resource id="183.306">Finally it was my turn, I use the facilities, go to the sink, find myself the only one there, and a constant line of guys behind me just filing out, again without using the sink.</resource>
  <resource id="183.307">All told about a dozen guys, and I was the only one who actually washed his hands.</resource>
  <resource id="183.308">There wasn't even a cursory, "pretend" wash amounting to little more than a cold water rinse.</resource>
  <resource id="183.309">I finally snapped and yelled out the door at the last two "DOES ANYONE WASH THEIR FRIGGING HANDS AFTER USING THE BATHROOM ANYMORE??"</resource>
  <resource id="183.310">Disgusted, I dried my hands, walked out, and yelled "PIGS!" toward the Burger King where a number of them had congregated for a late lunch.</resource>
  <resource id="183.311">Some were in the middle of eating, others were holding girl's hands or their children.</resource>
  <resource id="183.312">Lovely.</resource>
  <resource id="183.313">While I have no doubt whatsoever that my equipment is clean and disease free (I devote at least as much attention to cleaning that as I do my hands; any women dating these boys should be weary of the possible filth that probably accompanies sexual relations with him if he can't even take care of his hands), I cannot say the same for others, and cannot vouch for where their hands have been prior to touching the same surfaces that I have, such as the toilet seat, flush lever, and door handles.</resource>
  <resource id="183.314">Hey assholes, explain to your children where their cold sores came from: "Daddy didn't wash his hands in the restroom, then he cleaned the ketchup off your face, and now you have herpes."</resource>
  <resource id="183.315">Old guy, while it's unlikely that you'll catch something major from a dirty turnpike restroom, even a case of the flu could kill at your age.</resource>
  <resource id="183.316">Wash your damned hands.</resource>
  <resource id="183.317">Sure, if you were home and the only diseases you had to worry about on surfaces were the ones you already had, then fine, don't wash, you sick bastards, leave your scummy testicular material over household surfaces so that your grandchildren can pick up your crotch crickets and play with them before stuffing their hands in their mouths, but the one place you should be scrubbing up to the elbows while sobbing hysterically and crying "UNCLEAN!</resource>
  <resource id="183.318">UNCLEAN!" should at the very least be a public restroom on the interstate.</resource>
  <resource id="183.319">Simply entering one should make you feel dirty and in want of a shower.</resource>
  <resource id="183.320">So in any case, I'm home safe after an interesting visit to Michael and Holly's.</resource>
  <resource id="183.321">I didn't see much of Michael, he had to work during the day, then Holly and I skipped out to see a movie and left him with the kids.</resource>
  <resource id="183.322">We saw "Descent" at the local 'ghetto' theater, in the local 'ghetto' mall.</resource>
  <resource id="183.323">You know, it's like the Airport Mall here in Bangor: the automatic doors, for instance, aren't necessarily automatic anymore.</resource>
  <resource id="183.324">The theater itself hasn't been updated since approximately ET was first released.</resource>
  <resource id="183.325">It makes me appreciate the local cinemas that much more, (the former) Hoyt's and even the cheap seats at Spotlight in Orono all have the new stadium seats, bigger screens, and latest sound tech.</resource>
  <resource id="183.326">But it was nice to get out to the movies with Holly, I don't get to see her very much at all in any role other than as "mom", and as a single male with no kids, it's hard to associate myself with "parents."</resource>
  <resource id="183.327">Ask any comedian, they usually have a bit about the inability of the childless to relate to parents and vice versa.</resource>
  <resource id="183.328">Not that Erin has a problem, she loves kids and works with them, but I've never honestly been much of a kid person.</resource>
  <resource id="183.329">Older kids, sure, I can identify with short, immature but otherwise rational human beings, but little kids?</resource>
  <resource id="183.330">I have no clue.</resource>
  <resource id="183.331">What do I do when someone three feet tall smacks me in the head?</resource>
  <resource id="183.332">You can't beat them, you can't yell and foam at the mouth, but you can't ignore it either.</resource>
  <resource id="183.333">Raising children seems to be the personal equivalent of brokering peace in the Middle East: all sides are making promises that they almost immediately break, then claiming the other is responsible, starting fights and inflicting damage while whining and crying about their own bruises.</resource>
  <resource id="183.334">But unlike that said territory, children grow-up at some point, and most at least realize that you can't just go around pissing people off.</resource>
  <resource id="183.335">Though they undoubtedly do.</resource>
  <resource id="183.336">The movie itself sucked.</resource>
  <resource id="183.337">The production values were ok, but when the studio says that "we're the guys who brought you such and such a movie and this one is much worse" they're not talking about how gory or scary it is. It's not more gory, it's not scarier, it's quite literally worse, as in bad.</resource>
  <resource id="183.338">Tricky bastards.</resource>
  <resource id="183.339">The plot was just full of loopholes, there wasn't even any gratuitous boobage that you might otherwise associate with a Hollywood movie that stars an entire cast of nothing but athletic women.</resource>
  <resource id="183.340">No, these weren't the "oh I'm cute, see my ta-tas?" kind of athleticly built women, these were the "see me hang from the roof of a cave by my fingernails" type, the "I don't even need a sportsbra" kind of actual athletes.</resource>
  <resource id="183.341">Fine, the movie didn't pander to any primitive testosterone driven need to see scantily clad women prancing about, alot of good, enjoyable movies don't do so either.</resource>
  <resource id="183.342">But this one was just full of plot holes that you could drive a truck through.</resource>
  <resource id="183.343">Spoiler warning!</resource>
  <resource id="183.344">IF you actually want to see "The Descent" then stop here and go do your nails or something.</resource>
  <resource id="183.345">Ok, so at one point they find a dead moose in the middle of the cave system.</resource>
  <resource id="183.346">How did it get there?</resource>
  <resource id="183.347">"Oh they kill the food outside and bring it inside to eat."</resource>
  <resource id="183.348">Umm-kay, I can see that.</resource>
  <resource id="183.349">But on each side of this cavern, there are drop-offs of hundreds of feet that had to be traversed by clinging to the ceiling.</resource>
  <resource id="183.350">Further, there were tunnels on both sides that were so narrow that only one very healthy (little fat content) person on their stomach could barely squeeze through; in fact, at one point, a character gets stuck in such a tunnel.</resource>
  <resource id="183.351">So how the holy fuck did the cave-dwellers get a MOOSE through?</resource>
  <resource id="183.352">And what about the primitive cave paintings by the local natives thousands of years ago?</resource>
  <resource id="183.353">How did they traverse the chasms?</resource>
  <resource id="183.354">Would they bother?</resource>
  <resource id="183.355">Let's say you're some "primitive screwhead" and you come across a cave.</resource>
  <resource id="183.356">"Hey shelter" you think, good deal.</resource>
  <resource id="183.357">You explore for a little bit, then WHOOPS!</resource>
  <resource id="183.358">No floor!</resource>
  <resource id="183.359">Is your first thought "well, must find a way across?"</resource>
  <resource id="183.360">What about the tiny passages you'd have to squeeze through?</resource>
  <resource id="183.361">What's the point?</resource>
  <resource id="183.362">Did our primitive ancestors really do weird shit like spelunking for fun?</resource>
  <resource id="183.363">I don't find the idea of poking around in the dark deep in the bowels of the earth very entertaining at all, I don't think our ancestors, devoid of electric flashlights and safety equipment would be any more inclined to risking their life for so worthless an enterprise.</resource>
  <resource id="183.364">Is there food that deep in the cave?</resource>
  <resource id="183.365">Fresh water?</resource>
  <resource id="183.366">Safety?</resource>
  <resource id="183.367">Hell no.</resource>
  <resource id="183.368">So what's the point?</resource>
  <resource id="183.369">If this took place in the wilds of Africa, perhaps it might be worth venturing into the earth to escape the large predators that prayed upon human beings so very long ago, but even that was well before we took to cave drawing.</resource>
  <resource id="183.370">After the movie and the subsequent discussion as to all the different ways it was just simply retarded, we came back to the house and watched TiVo.</resource>
  <resource id="183.371">Holly's gotten really into Dog the Bounty Hunter and we watched an episode of that.</resource>
  <resource id="183.372">It's alright, it's like American Choppers in that I enjoy it if there's really nothing else to watch.</resource>
  <resource id="183.373">We also caught a couple episodes of that new Stan Lee show about the wanna-be super heros on SciFi.</resource>
  <resource id="183.374">It was better than I expected.</resource>
  <resource id="183.375">I'm already convinced that Feedback will win, he just looks the part of a modern comic book figure.</resource>
  <resource id="183.376">Major Victory is entertaining, but he's got an old-school look to him, like the original Batman or Superman.</resource>
  <resource id="183.377">Comics and subsequent spin-off media such as movies reflect the point I'm making: the whole shebang has gotten darker, both literally and figuratively.</resource>
  <resource id="183.378">Black suits for Spiderman and Superman for instance.</resource>
  <resource id="183.379">Characters getting killed, having issues, various mental and physical illnesses.</resource>
  <resource id="183.380">They're less camp and more drama, see the progression from Original Batman series to the movies starring Clooney and Kilmer, then ending with the dark, dramatic Batman Begins.</resource>
  <resource id="183.381">Look at Superman: the original television Reeves was a fatman in tights with no issues, his movie successor had human flaws and frailties.</resource>
  <resource id="183.382">Spoiler alert!!</resource>
  <resource id="183.383">WHOOP WHOOP WHOOP: The newest incarnation is totally buff and pines over the family he doesn't have, before ending up in the hospital and nearly dying.</resource>
  <resource id="183.384">Cue "Our Lady Peace - Superman's Dead", good song.</resource>
  <resource id="183.385">"Do you worry that you're not liked?</resource>
  <resource id="183.386">How long til you break?</resource>
  <resource id="183.387">You're happy cause you smile, but how much can you fake?</resource>
  <resource id="183.388">An ordinary boy, with an ordinary name, but ordinary's just not good enough today."</resource>
  <resource id="183.389">Yea ok, so I don't know what this has to do with the refrain, but it's a catchy tune.</resource>
  <resource id="183.390">We watch tube for a few hours, I watch Holly fold clothes, I head to bed in the basement then get up the next morning to watch Spiderman 2 with her and the kids.</resource>
  <resource id="183.391">Then I head home around lunch time.</resource>
  <resource id="183.392">That trip was a trip, as in "whoops nearly fell on your face there didn't you?"</resource>
  <resource id="183.393">The turnpike was nuts, every asshole from Jersey and Connecticut was apparently heading to Canada.</resource>
  <resource id="183.394">It was so packed that all three lanes were barely crawling along at the speed limit, let alone any faster.</resource>
  <resource id="183.395">At about Biddeford, I jumped-ship and headed up Route One, expecting an "accident" the likes of which I experienced the last time I headed home from NH by myself.</resource>
  <resource id="183.396">Imagine: three lanes of traffic, none of it moving, for the better part of two hours.</resource>
  <resource id="183.397">Come Scarborough, I jumped back on, since Route One was pretty packed, and I didn't want to go through downtown Portland.</resource>
  <resource id="183.398">I abandoned the turnpike last time as well, shortly after the traffic jam cleared, and ended up getting home 4 hours later than expected and having just enough time to get ready for work before heading out again.</resource>
  <resource id="183.399">It kind of sucked.</resource>
  <resource id="183.400">So back on the pike, putting up with traffic, speeds picked up to well above where they should have been, things cleared a little north of Lewiston, a little more above Augusta, but it was still pretty frigging busy all the way up.</resource>
  <resource id="183.401">Got into Bangor, picked up my check, went home and waited for Erin.</resource>
  <resource id="183.402">Spent some time with her, watched a little "Storm of the Century" on DVD (the bargain bin rules), then took a nap before work, where I am now.</resource>
  <resource id="183.403">How can I blog so extensively at work?</resource>
  <resource id="183.404">The new guy is still training, and since he goes live on his own next weekend, he needs to ensure he can actually do the job on his own.</resource>
  <resource id="183.405">So I'm not doing shit unless absolutely necessary.</resource>
  <resource id="183.406">Yes, in effect, I've become a Supervisor.</resource>
  <resource id="183.407">I'm so proud of myself.</resource>
  <resource id="183.408">Sniff.</resource>

  <resource id="184.409">Pete Rose runs over Indians catcher, Ray Fosse to score the winning run of the 1970 All Star Game.</resource>
  <resource id="184.410">Fosse's career was never the same.</resource>
  <resource id="184.411">Teams---1---2---3---4---5---6----Final</resource>
  <resource id="184.412">Nick------1---0---1---12--2---2----18</resource>
  <resource id="184.413">Marco----2---2---1---1---7---0----13</resource>
  <resource id="184.414">Well, today was a beautiful day for baseball and I have missed it so much that I decided to ask Marco to come.</resource>
  <resource id="184.415">Yeah, cocky, supercilious Marco Starnoni who eats as if he had been walking in the desert feasting on nothing but manna for forty years.</resource>
  <resource id="184.416">Well, it was an all right game.</resource>
  <resource id="184.417">We scored twelve runs in the 4th inning because of some shoddy defense by Marco's team.</resource>
  <resource id="184.418">Let's just say they gave us at least five outs but probably more.</resource>
  <resource id="184.419">The inning would just never end.</resource>
  <resource id="184.420">I was beginning to roll my eyes at it in laughter.</resource>
  <resource id="184.421">I had quite a few homeruns and was involved on the wrong side of a great defensive play turned in by Joe Twarogowski.</resource>
  <resource id="184.422">In the 3rd inning, I tried to score when a throw to third base got away.</resource>
  <resource id="184.423">I came racing down the line as Ryan Shalek picked up the loose ball and fired a strike to home plate.</resource>
  <resource id="184.424">Joey, who was blocking home plate, reached up and snared the ball as I arrived at the plate.</resource>
  <resource id="184.425">I tucked my shoulder down and leveled a defenseless Joe.</resource>
  <resource id="184.426">He went flying backwards and landed with a huge thud in the left-handed batter's box.</resource>
  <resource id="184.427">Upon hitting the ground, he pulled the ball out of his glove and into his bare hand and showed everyone he had held on to complete the double play.</resource>
  <resource id="184.428">When I asked him whether he was all right, he said he was and proceeded to tell me that he knew it was coming.</resource>
  <resource id="184.429">He saw the play unfolding but had no way to brace for it because of the high throw and the simultaneous arrival of me and the ball.</resource>
  <resource id="184.430">Oh well, how often does one see a collision at home plate anyway?</resource>
  <resource id="184.431">You just have to think though of the consequences when two people meet at one point in that vicious a nature.</resource>
  <resource id="184.432">Who can forget Ray Fosse and Pete Rose's encounter at home plate in the 12th inning of the 1970 All Star Game?</resource>
  <resource id="184.433">This play remains perdurably etched in baseball history as the greatest play at the plate of all time.</resource>
  <resource id="184.434">Jim Hickman lines a base hit to center, Amos Otis comes up firing to the plate, the third base coach, Leo Durocher waves Pete Rose home, the throw brings then Indians' catcher, Ray Fosse a few feet up the line, and then it happens.</resource>
  <resource id="184.435">Pete Rose knocks Ray Fosse into baseball lore and permanantly knocks his shoulder into a somewhat more precarious place.</resource>
  <resource id="184.436">Pete Rose scores the game-winning run and Ray Fosse, the Indians' seemingly promising beacon, is never the same ball player.</resource>
  <resource id="184.437">So, in the end, we held on to win by a score of 18-13.</resource>
  <resource id="184.438">Joe was fine after taking one of the hardest shots any catcher has ever taken in the six years we've been playing ball together.</resource>
  <resource id="184.439">That is probably the reason most leagues have banned the runner from destroying the catcher like that.</resource>
  <resource id="184.440">Yes, injuries can happen but, as a former catcher, it's the most exhilarating play in sports.</resource>
  <resource id="184.441">There is nothing like being in a train wreck at home plate especially if you hang on to the ball for the out.</resource>
  <resource id="184.442">Joe said it doesn't happen that often so it doesn't bother him.</resource>
  <resource id="184.443">It would if it were a constant occurence but that was the first time this year that we had had a collision at home plate and probably the last.</resource>
  <resource id="184.444">There is usually one good hit each season and that is it.</resource>
  <resource id="184.445">Joe said the only sensation going through his body when he hit the ground was that he had to go to the bathroom badly.</resource>
  <resource id="184.446">That was kind of funny.</resource>
  <resource id="184.447">It's not as if Joe has never gotten me before.</resource>
  <resource id="184.448">I remember it as though it were yesterday.</resource>
  <resource id="184.449">June 5th, 2003.</resource>
  <resource id="184.450">Joe was on third and there was a runner on second with one out in a 6-6 tie in the bottom of the 6th inning.</resource>
  <resource id="184.451">We were intentionally walking Ahsan to load the bases up.</resource>
  <resource id="184.452">As I threw one of the pitches back to Billy, Joe broke for home plate.</resource>
  <resource id="184.453">I screamed for Billy to throw it and he did.</resource>
  <resource id="184.454">I jumped in front of home plate and the ball deflected off my glove and Joe just crushed me. He bounced off me and rolled behind home plate.</resource>
  <resource id="184.455">I landed by the ball and picked it up with my bare hand.</resource>
  <resource id="184.456">I turned around and swiped at Joe and missed as he hit home plate with his foot and his whole team just raced to the plate and mobbed him as they won, 7-6.</resource>
  <resource id="184.457">Ahsan says he still remembers that play.</resource>
  <resource id="184.458">He says he and Joe knew we were loading the bases for their two worst hitters to get the game into extra innings so they devised a play that involved Joe's trying to steal home.</resource>
  <resource id="184.459">Ahsan told me that he remembers the collision mostly because the game was being played in the rain and we very rarely play when it's raining.</resource>
  <resource id="184.460">He saw us sprawled out on the ground and thought for sure Joe was out.</resource>
  <resource id="184.461">Then he saw the ball lying on the ground and screamed for Joe to touch home.</resource>
  <resource id="184.462">It was probably the greatest play of all time in the six years we've organized our games.</resource>
  <resource id="184.463">I remember walking off the field disgusted with myself.</resource>
  <resource id="184.464">Believe me, I have still never seen a celebration like that again in a friendly baseball game.</resource>
  <resource id="184.465">It was as if they had won the World Series.</resource>
  <resource id="184.466">They completely mobbed Joe and were bounding around home plate as if Joe were the king of baseball.</resource>
  <resource id="184.467">All right, that's all I want to say.</resource>
  <resource id="184.468">Good night my faithful blog acolytes.</resource>

<block id="block 185">
  <resource id="185.470">My brother and I just went out to go for a bike ride.</resource>
  <resource id="185.471">I checked my bike tire, and though it was quite bent and warped, I was still able to go biking.</resource>
  <resource id="185.472">I liked that, I am really happy to be able to ride again.</resource>
  <resource id="185.473">However, due to the fact that my Knee is still a little weak, and my tire is bent and rubbing against the brake, I had some difficulty riding, but Sam and I enjoyed a little bike ride up to the Bank.</resource>
  <resource id="185.474">The reason I was at the bank was to check to see if Dad had deposited the 56 dollar Government GST cheque into my account yet.</resource>
  <resource id="185.475">What I did, to see, was check to see what my balance was.</resource>
  <resource id="185.476">It was 62 dollars, that's precisely 56 dollars more than I had.</resource>
  <resource id="185.477">Bonus!</resource>
  <resource id="185.478">So I went to take out my 60 dollars, and it said I couldn't take it, because my available funds was limited to 6 dollars.</resource>
  <resource id="185.479">I was pretty bummed out, because it meant they put a hold on my cheque, I hate when they do that, what's the bloody point?</resource>
  <resource id="185.480">Especially when it's a bloody government cheque.</resource>
  <resource id="185.481">It wouldn't bother me much, except the last government cheque I deposited had no hold on it.</resource>
  <resource id="185.482">It was 122 dollars (money I promptly blew on DVD's and Food).</resource>
  <resource id="185.483">I am glad that Dad deposited it, despite the fact that he was angry with mom (my parents are bad for holding silly and pointless grudges.)</resource>
  <resource id="185.484">So, here I am with money RIGHT there that I can't get a hold of, and I really want to spend it at the Furmeet on Monday.</resource>
  <resource id="185.485">We furries are going to the Mongolian restaurant for a hangout from 7-9 before the meet, because sometimes we like to hang out and go bowling or swim for the meets.</resource>
  <resource id="185.486">We're a cool group, I won't shut up about that.</resource>
  <resource id="185.487">So, my brother is here for a while, and he really wants to go to the meet with me. Problem is, Dad won't let him.</resource>
  <resource id="185.488">I'm not sure if it's just that he thinks I'm weird or if he just doesn't trust Sam in London.</resource>
  <resource id="185.489">I get the feeling Dad doesn't want Sam to go weird on him.</resource>
  <resource id="185.490">Like I said a while ago, Dad said he was gonna buy Sam a pound of weed, a 2-4 of beer, and a led Zeppelin album so that he had at least one normal kid.</resource>
  <resource id="185.491">I'm not sure what that says about dad, but in a way I can't blame him.</resource>
  <resource id="185.492">He's pretty old fashioned, but not rude about it.</resource>
  <resource id="185.493">He's not ignorant, just old fashioned (which is pretty damn rare.)</resource>
  <resource id="185.494">We think we're pretty close to letting Sam go with me but I would end up sleeping at Ixyao's again, because by the looks of it, Loth is spending the night in London again with his girlfriend.</resource>
  <resource id="185.495">(And who can blame him?)</resource>
  <resource id="185.496">Earlier today, I put on Elfenking - Seasonspeech, and mom asked me if I ever listened to radio music anymore.</resource>
  <resource id="185.497">I pretty much told her "nope, not much." And she then proceeded to tell me how she'd noticed I'd been listening to Celtic music, and other odd stuff lately.</resource>
  <resource id="185.498">She was actually meaning to say it kind of as a "you're weird" sentiment, but I took it as the highest of compliments.</resource>
  <resource id="185.499">I pride myself on listening to a wide variety of music.</resource>
  <resource id="185.500">I swelled with pride.</resource>
  <resource id="185.501">Scott moved out this morning.</resource>
  <resource id="185.502">I was sad, but I helped him move his stuff.</resource>
  <resource id="185.503">Despite the large load of stuff he took, I barely notice a difference in the house.</resource>
  <resource id="185.504">The place looks just as full as it did when he was living here.</resource>
  <resource id="185.505">It's hard to think that it may be a long time before I see him again.</resource>
  <resource id="185.506">I've already told mom I'm moving on the weekend of the 26th, and I just need to get a hold of Andrea so I can make the plans formal.</resource>
  <resource id="185.507">Now I need to find a place to put all my stuff at Andrea's. I know my DVD shelf would have no problem finding a place in the livingroom, but the computer, the bed, the dresser, and my electronics would need to find a home in my room.</resource>
  <resource id="185.508">I could probably find a way to swing it, but it would be a little cramped.</resource>
  <resource id="185.509">There's no way I could put my chairs there, and I don't want to trash em, I would like to give them to a friend or something at the least.</resource>
  <resource id="185.510">I love my chairs *sniffs*</resource>
  <resource id="185.511">On a less tragic note, I redid my OSAP application with mom's info.</resource>
  <resource id="185.512">I also tried to do my timetable, today was the first day I can set the timetable.</resource>
  <resource id="185.513">It took me a while to figure out how to do it, but I did finally figure it out, and I did what I could to keep Monday night and Tuesday morning open.</resource>
  <resource id="185.514">That way I can go to the Furmeets, Jason also did the same thing, he has Mondays off so he can go to the furmeet.</resource>
  <resource id="185.515">That's funny, I think, that we love the furries so much that we're willing to schedule our schooling around the meets.</resource>
  <resource id="185.516">Woohoo!</resource>
  <resource id="185.517">However, when I went to submit my timetable, I was asked to pay the rest of my tuition.</resource>
  <resource id="185.518">I was kind of confused.</resource>
  <resource id="185.519">as when I asked the representative, they said that as long as I paid my 400 dollars, I wouldn't have to worry about the rest of my costs until OSAP made a decision, and until then, I could go ahead, schedule, and do my thing.</resource>
  <resource id="185.520">I need to make another few calls, but mom's in Norwich and has the only phone that works right now.</resource>
  <resource id="185.521">It also said that I have to register for some student success thing, and I have to call in.</resource>
  <resource id="185.522">Same deal, I have the number written down on a piece of paper so I don't forget when the time comes.</resource>
  <resource id="185.523">I also have my MoCoMotion password and username right here, not to mention my OSAP access number, and all the numbers I need to call right here with me. I am PREPARED.</resource>
  <resource id="185.524">And since I put that I was living with mother, and she only makes 6000 a year, I can almost guarantee that I will get accepted for OSAP, and they said they'll pay 8700 for this year.</resource>
  <resource id="185.525">which is crazy good, especially if I'm living with Andrea, who only asks for internet, hydro, and food.</resource>
  <resource id="185.526">For me, internet would be like 25 bucks, hydro, another 30 or 40, and food.</resource>
  <resource id="185.527">well, I could splurge.</resource>
  <resource id="185.528">I do have to pay something like 300 dollars a semester for the Mohawk Brantford to Mohawk Hamilton bus.</resource>
  <resource id="185.529">If I was to get a job on Campus or off campus on top of that, I COULD be living a fairly kind lifestyle.</resource>
  <resource id="185.530">And the government still owes me 680 dollars.</resource>
  <resource id="185.531">and they say for this semester, I only owe them 1044.12.</resource>
  <resource id="185.532">That means if I get a part time job, even if I don't get OSAP, I could still pay for tuition, I just need to worry about food and transportation.</resource>
  <resource id="185.533">Either way, I'm thinking it's looking pretty good.</resource>
  <resource id="185.534">However I still am desperate for a girlfriend, but I want to love someone, not lust for someone, despite the fact that I'm so bad right now that I can't help but mentally strip every decent looking girl I see.</resource>
  <resource id="185.535">It's not that male hormones are finally catching up, it's that I'm so horny and lonely that I would do anything to get fuckin laid, short of paying a hooker.</resource>
  <resource id="185.536">sorry, I'm not into that.</resource>
  <resource id="185.537">Yeah, vulgar, I know, but even if I had a friend with benefits, I would go the way of Andrea and do it to get it out of the way.</resource>
  <resource id="185.538">So, tomorrow I am busy.</resource>
  <resource id="185.539">Sam and I are both working for Burgessville Rocks for Whitney.</resource>
  <resource id="185.540">I get to be ticket bitch, and I get more volunteer hours and experience.</resource>
  <resource id="185.541">Alphabeta for two years, and now this.</resource>
  <resource id="185.542">Try to tell me that it's not impressive to see on a resume.</resource>
  <resource id="185.543">Which I should print up next week, when I find the time, after I get the info.</resource>
  <resource id="185.544">I need to have them ready so I can be looking for a job In Brantford after school.</resource>
  <resource id="185.545">I am getting my shit in GEAR, because I am not gonna be sore and alone and helpless like other members of my family.</resource>
  <resource id="185.546">Nuh uh!</resource>
  <resource id="185.547">None of that for the Runa.</resource>
  <resource id="185.548">I finally feel a little more independent.</resource>
  <resource id="185.549">I am looking to drive more so I can get my G2, I am solid in my belief that I am going to Brantford on the 26th, I am no longer indecisive, I want to get away from the issue between my parents, and I am looking to be very assertive for college.</resource>
  <resource id="185.550">Here's a list of the things I need to do.</resource>
  <resource id="185.551">#1, print off the OSAP thing the government wants me to.</resource>
  <resource id="185.552">I just need it to get mom's signature, then I think I mail it to the government when they decide or something.</resource>
  <resource id="185.553">I need to do that ASAP.</resource>
  <resource id="185.554">After that, I then make my calls to mohawk to ask about the money issue, the tuition and my schedules.</resource>
  <resource id="185.555">#3, I then call about that student success thing, I need to re look into that, but until I have a phone I can't do shit.</resource>
  <resource id="185.556">#4, move to Andreas and get comfortable there while looking for an after school job.</resource>
  <resource id="185.557">#5 talk to the people concerning the shuttlebus from Brantford to Mohawk.</resource>
  <resource id="185.558">Problem is, I can't do any of these things right now, so I keep them all in mind, and become impatient to get access to a phone, and I am gonna look up info on the shuttlebus.</resource>
  <resource id="185.559">Courses just opened up, so it's not like I'm late, they've been open for a whole 12 hours, and I can register until mid September, so I've got some time, however, I don't want to wait, that's why I went on the site this morning to do it ASAP.</resource>
  <resource id="185.560">So, tomorrow's gonna make me a little sad.</resource>
  <resource id="185.561">I have the choice to either go to this Burgessville Rocks thing, go to London to watch movies with the Furries, or go to Brantford with Jason to sling some haybales and make some more cash (oh yeah, Tim owes me like 30 bucks too, on top of the 60 in my bank) so apparently I do well with the cash.</resource>
  <resource id="185.562">Not to mention the 680.</resource>
  <resource id="185.563">I will be okay until I move to Andreas, and for a little while afterwards, I'm in no rush, but I want to be ahead of the crowd.</resource>
  <resource id="185.564">You know, do my thing, be independent.</resource>
  <resource id="185.565">I know I CAN do it, I just want college, that's my thing.</resource>
  <resource id="185.566">Anyway, the smart part of me says to go to Jason's, make some cash, get stronger, get ready and train my leg to be stronger (like I did on my bike.)</resource>
  <resource id="185.567">But frankly, he really creeped me out when I saw him last.</resource>
  <resource id="185.568">I know Jason needs friends and support, and I try to be there for him, but he keeps creeping me out.</resource>
  <resource id="185.569">However, the loyal part of me says that since I made a promise to Whit, even though it's unpaid work, I should go to Burgessville.</resource>
  <resource id="185.570">I mean, I told her on July 25th, or somewhere around there, that I'd come help out, and I wasn't backing out this time.</resource>
  <resource id="185.571">Plus I get to see Whit, Sam, Will, and the whole High School Crew.</resource>
  <resource id="185.572">I miss em all and they're the smartest, most responsible group I've ever been a part of.</resource>
  <resource id="185.573">However, the playful, devil-may-care part of me tells me to fuck em all and go to London to watch movies with the Furs.</resource>
  <resource id="185.574">I would love to, as I've become very close with them, but it's not good for me, as I have no way there, no way back, and I would feel bad if I left on Whit.</resource>
  <resource id="185.575">In fact, I sent her an email, and she still hasn't responded, so I don't know when she'll be here.</resource>
  <resource id="185.576">I will be on all night waiting.</resource>
  <resource id="185.577">You know what pisses me off?</resource>
  <resource id="185.578">Flamers.</resource>
  <resource id="185.579">Not flamboyant Homosexuals, but people on message boards and forums.</resource>
  <resource id="185.580">People like a guy I know named Pisher, and Kuellere.</resource>
  <resource id="185.581">Both are people who go on the Boxofficemojo forums.</resource>
  <resource id="185.582">Just as an example, here's something he wrote.</resource>
  <resource id="185.583">"But Runa216 - I thought you and Rondoze liked each other in a non platonic way :P</resource>
  <resource id="185.584">Rondoze, I think I see the source of our misunderstanding.</resource>
  <resource id="185.585">You weren't saying there was a majority of people who thought SR was a really good movie--you were just saying there were more people who thought it was 'alright, nothing special', than people who thought it was 'awful, a huge disappointment'.</resource>
  <resource id="185.586">Well, I doubt Gallup will ever find the time to actually prove this through extensive opinion polling of carefully chosen demographic samples, but you COULD be right--there could be slightly more people in the 'alright, nothing special' camp than the 'awful, huge disappointment' camp.</resource>
  <resource id="185.587">It's a defensible opinion, however unproven.</resource>
  <resource id="185.588">So sorry to have misunderstand you, it would help if you learned how to write."</resource>
  <resource id="185.589">People like him bug me, not because they disagree with me, but because when you disagree with them, they resort to insults, and we all know how men need to have big balls and can't lose to another man, people always fall into a fight, or as it's known online, a flame war.</resource>
  <resource id="185.590">I try to stay out of them, as I can't stand my intelligence being lowered to their level, but sometimes I just want to do what Jay and Silent Bob did.</resource>
  <resource id="185.591">go to their houses and smash their faces in because they like to aggravate.</resource>
  <resource id="185.592">just because they can.</resource>
  <resource id="185.593">When I go on a messageboard about movies, I like discussing things like which film was better, Pirates or Superman.</resource>
  <resource id="185.594">I personally enjoyed Pirates more, but I thought Superman was far more artistically done with a fantastic story.</resource>
  <resource id="185.595">Whereas you go on there, on one side there are people constantly saying that pirates sucked, and that nobody is allowed to like it because it sucked and it was horrible.</resource>
  <resource id="185.596">etc. or you have the folks trying to tell you that Superman was horrible.</resource>
  <resource id="185.597">despite the fact that it made nearly 200 million dollars.</resource>
  <resource id="185.598">It bothers me that people can't discuss without anger.</resource>
  <resource id="185.599">It's disgusting that I have to feel relieved when I find a thread that has people calmly discussing sides of an argument.</resource>
  <resource id="185.600">Well, I'm gonna go post on a board and try to ignore the flames.</resource>
  <resource id="185.601">In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight.</resource>

  <resource id="186.604">I just want you to see what's been sitting out on the patio upstairs for FOUR DAYS, so you can grasp how terribly easy it would be for someone who is probably around my age or a little younger, and not in terribly bad shape, to carry it all of about 100 feet to a dumpster and throw it away.</resource>

  <resource id="188.631">I don't know whether or not to be slightly DISGUSTED at the fact that NOBODY happenend to mention what's developed in the news, in the past, tedious 48 hours, in which I had to take a flight, to return home, THANKFULLY safely, having not been detrinated in mid-air, by a plot so ingenious, we are INCREDIBLY lucky that it was indeed thwarted.</resource>

  <resource id="189.641">For ages now I've been doing this self defence class and at the beginning of every class we get a stern talking too about not doing any of this stuff at home, and I've just discovered why.</resource>
  <resource id="189.642">Lat night, while trying to demonstrate to Tequila Boy how effectlivley I could beat him up if he ever had a complete change of personality and decided to attack me I slipped on the carpet trying to demonstrate a roundhouse kick fell backwards and hit the wall with what I'm assured was a sickening crack.</resource>
  <resource id="189.643">I bounced up and tried to shrug it off, something that was made a bit difficult by the blood on the wall.</resource>
  <resource id="189.644">But it didn't hurt and it didn't seem to be bleeding to much so I shrugged ot off and went to bed.</resource>
  <resource id="189.645">This morning I had to go in to wake Tequila Boy with blood matted in my hair and all down the back of my neck, "I don't mean to alarm you but I think I need someone to take me to A&amp;E." So this morning was spent in the casualty waiting room trying to come up with a less silly story for how I came to crack the back of my head open, only had to wait half an hour before being seen, God I love the NHS.</resource>
  <resource id="189.646">So now I have five staples in the back of my head.</resource>

<block id="block 190">
  <resource id="190.651">I can't wait TO see what Jon Stewart has to say on the Daily Show tonight!</resource>
  <resource id="190.652">OK, I wasn't even going to write anything today until this was brought to my attention: August 12 is Presidential Joke Day!</resource>
  <resource id="190.653">So, just to set folks straight as to my political leanings: our current president, IMHO, IS a joke.</resource>
  <resource id="190.654">In fact, I bought TOILET PAPER of George Bush stupid quotes.</resource>
  <resource id="190.655">Now I'm on my political soapbox, so if you find opposition to the Republican regime distasteful, feel free to exit now.</resource>
  <resource id="190.656">On a more serious note, just open up any paper or online news provider and you will find things that *should* alarm you, and which definitely are bothering me! Here is just an example from Yahoo News:</resource>
  <resource id="190.657">"WASHINGTON - While the British terror suspects were hatching their plot, the Bush administration was quietly seeking permission to divert $6 million that was supposed to be spent this year developing new homeland explosives detection technology."</resource>
  <resource id="190.658">(Click here for full story.)</resource>
  <resource id="190.659">We have spent billions of dollars and countless human capital expenditure on the whole Homeland Security division.</resource>
  <resource id="190.660">We diverted funds from FEMA for this organization which, in my mind, was directly (and I mean DIRECTLY) tied to the disaster Katrina brought to the South.</resource>
  <resource id="190.661">That does not even begin to address the loss of our civil liberties and the insidious spread of a Gestapo or KGB-like mentality that most of America just seems to be blissfully unaware of.</resource>
  <resource id="190.662">Your phone calls are tapped.</resource>
  <resource id="190.663">Your email isn't private.</resource>
  <resource id="190.664">The government can and WILL find you no matter what steps you take to try and get some privacy.</resource>
  <resource id="190.665">Perhaps I'm being an alarmist, but the loss of privacy and personal freedom in the name of "security" SCARES me. I am fine with heightened security at airports.</resource>
  <resource id="190.666">In fact, last night my Mom asked me if I am "scared" of flying and going on our trip.</resource>
  <resource id="190.667">Honestly, I think it means that we will be SAFER for the next few months traveling.</resource>
  <resource id="190.668">Yes, we will need to be at the airport earlier, and we will be inconvenienced regarding carry on luggage, but that is a small price to pay to know that we are going to be safe.</resource>
  <resource id="190.669">It's the pervasive spread of "Big Brother Is Watching You" that concerns me. Some people say "we only have to put up with this for two more years" while I say, "Get me a job in Canada!"</resource>

  <resource id="191.670">Two wrongs can make a right in small situations.</resource>
  <resource id="191.671">One such being the slight civil annoyance of another commuter's feet riding pride high on the train seats.</resource>
  <resource id="191.672">Despite the posted signs and hypocrisy of sitting in another's filth, perpetrators of this small act continue to thrive in the misery of others.</resource>
  <resource id="191.673">Often only concerned in self removal in busy or peak times.</resource>
  <resource id="191.674">Sadly, due to current legal mud pies, forcefully conveying the issues and negatives concerned with sitting in such a state are verboten.</resource>
  <resource id="191.675">Cases include dynamically potent scenarios as suddenly bending knees backward or clipping ankles from the slamming turn of the back rest.</resource>
  <resource id="191.676">Plausibility deniable.</resource>
  <resource id="191.677">Knowing the majority's aversion to confrontations and speaking out, a ride with the feet up on the seats can usually last the entirety of a journey.</resource>
  <resource id="191.678">This works in their favour.</resource>
  <resource id="191.679">It can also be turned against them.</resource>
  <resource id="191.680">For those who feel powerless and fearful of repercussions, yet want to take action, there is always something more grating than knowing someone either cannot read or show respect for public seating areas.</resource>
  <resource id="191.681">The simple and slight constant sound of rustling plastic or paper directly behind such a display has been known to be effective in at least shifting the person into another section of the car.</resource>
  <resource id="191.682">Away from view and made to be the problem of another set of commuters.</resource>

  <resource id="196.738">The fireworks were beautiful.</resource>
  <resource id="196.739">No words can describe them.</resource>
  <resource id="196.740">They speak for themselves as they dazzled you, shooting into the mid-sky, and then falling down.</resource>
  <resource id="196.741">The only way to enjoy them, is to live that moment.</resource>
  <resource id="196.742">Like all things, the fireworks do not last.</resource>
  <resource id="196.743">Their lifespan is only that few seconds, where they brightened up against the backdrop of the night.</resource>
  <resource id="196.744">Then, they are gone.</resource>
  <resource id="196.745">You can only savour them for that moment.</resource>
  <resource id="196.746">Miss it and that is it.</resource>
  <resource id="196.747">I watched the 15-min fireworks with mixed feelings.</resource>
  <resource id="196.748">The last time I watched them so close up was back when I was still a young child.</resource>
  <resource id="196.749">Those feelings then and the feelings today were so different.</resource>
  <resource id="196.750">Back then, everything was simple.</resource>
  <resource id="196.751">Life was tough, but simpler.</resource>
  <resource id="196.752">Fleeting thoughts dashed across my mind as I looked at the fireworks today.</resource>
  <resource id="196.753">Why is life so much more complex now.</resource>
  <resource id="196.754">What is it that I want out of my life.</resource>
  <resource id="196.755">Where should I go on from here.</resource>
  <resource id="196.756">Questions, only questions, with no answers.</resource>
  <resource id="196.757">3rd guy sms-ed me, 3 times in 3 days time.</resource>
  <resource id="196.758">I am weak.</resource>
  <resource id="196.759">I gave in to temptation.</resource>
  <resource id="196.760">Was this how Eve felt when Satan tempted her with the forbidden fruit.</resource>
  <resource id="196.761">I replied him, asking him to give me a call, which he did.</resource>
  <resource id="196.762">We chatted for a while.</resource>
  <resource id="196.763">He told me about his work and his regime for his upcoming marathon.</resource>
  <resource id="196.764">Once again, I was like caught in the web, unable to free myself.</resource>
  <resource id="196.765">However, one thing I felt as I chatted with him was, my feelings for him have somewhat mellowed.</resource>
  <resource id="196.766">No longer do I have the urge to be with him.</resource>
  <resource id="196.767">I just wanted someone I can confide about the difficulties I faced at work and the void in my life.</resource>
  <resource id="196.768">My friend who was with me during the fireworks commented that we feel a void in life as majority of our needs have been fulfilled.</resource>
  <resource id="196.769">Maslow theory about our basic needs being met and wanting to find other purposes in life.</resource>
  <resource id="196.770">I do not agree with her as my basic needs are not fulfilled yet.</resource>
  <resource id="196.771">I have yet to establish a career for myself.</resource>
  <resource id="196.772">I am still not satisfied with my salary nor the housing that I am staying at.</resource>
  <resource id="196.773">There are still hundreds and one things that I want.</resource>
  <resource id="196.774">Yet, I do not know the means to achieve them.</resource>
  <resource id="196.775">I feel so lost.</resource>
  <resource id="196.776">I dislike this feeling of hopelessness and not knowing where I am heading.</resource>

  <resource id="200.835">so much has happened since the last time i updates.</resource>
  <resource id="200.836">theres to many stories to tell here so i'll just give the general outline of p2p:</resource>
  <resource id="200.837">39 kids, 4 leaders, 1 amazing Irish woman named lynn, and 3 weeks in england ireland and wales can only lead to a once in a life time experience.</resource>
  <resource id="200.838">at first i wasn't convinced that i would literally make friendships to last a life time but that changed as soon as we got on the plane.</resource>
  <resource id="200.839">mel, sully, steve, adam, gibbs, artur, erin, jacqui, will, leanne, nikki,justin, jeffy, steph, all the catherines/katies, kaela, bree, sarah grady (future president of 2005 haha), sarah p, caitlin g i love you all.</resource>
  <resource id="200.840">you made this trip amazing and i don't know what i'm gonna do without you.</resource>
  <resource id="200.841">from the all nighters in sneem (and mel and i having to keep sully from beating up those 10 year old irish boys who threw stuff at us), to that first night in london (bad first impressions w/ mel haha)and the last night at the heathrow hotel (soooo sad), the intense spoon games, the leaders telling us about deadly eels in the lakes of kilarney and man killing sheep in wales, the repelling down castles, to the crazy/fun times at caer llan (actually all the places we stayed haha, all the carnivals/parades/fairs we went too, and everything in between, i honestly had the time of my life.</resource>
  <resource id="200.842">so i came back right in time, right before heathrow airport was put on severe high alert.</resource>
  <resource id="200.843">i'm really lucky about that.</resource>
  <resource id="200.844">and then came my birthday!</resource>
  <resource id="200.845">lets just say i never want to drive a manual car again.</resource>
  <resource id="200.846">i'm actually pretty good at driving a normal car, so i'm excited.</resource>

  <resource id="216.3">or maybe there has been.</resource>
  <resource id="216.4">I'm away from the boring life of the Illinois Valley yah!</resource>
  <resource id="216.5">I love living in Chicago there is so much to do and I feel like I never have time to do anything anymore.</resource>
  <resource id="216.6">There is always so much stuff I have to do each day that before I know it the day is gone.</resource>
  <resource id="216.7">I think so far the city has really opened my mind up to certain things.</resource>
  <resource id="216.8">The people here even at Columbia are so different than I expected.</resource>
  <resource id="216.9">Sure I've been to Chicago many many times but living here is a whole other experience.</resource>
  <resource id="216.10">Being here makes me realize how sheltered I've been all my life.</resource>
  <resource id="216.11">I'm loving school at Columbia.</resource>
  <resource id="216.12">I feel more at ease now that I kind of know what I want to do with my life, but more scared because I feel like everyone is a step ahead of me. I have to admit though school has me freaked out about my future.</resource>
  <resource id="216.13">My Marketing Strategies class always keeps me thinking about it.</resource>
  <resource id="216.14">I'm scared to death about getting a job after school.</resource>
  <resource id="216.15">I can't wait, but I'm nervous as hell now.</resource>
  <resource id="216.16">What if nothing goes as planned and I can't get a job and I'm stuck doing something that I hate?</resource>
  <resource id="216.17">Eh.</resource>
  <resource id="216.18">Today I exchanged numbers with a girl in my class so we can study for our Midterm.</resource>
  <resource id="216.19">One of the girls who is also in my class was in the elevator.</resource>
  <resource id="216.20">She was saying how she had the same area code and that she's from Spring Valley Weird huh?</resource>
  <resource id="216.21">The weirdest part is her roomate is someone who I went to school with since jr. high.</resource>

  <resource id="217.28">It was definitely a shocking experience, but atleast I can say I have ridden in an ambulance before.</resource>
  <resource id="217.29">Have lots of prescriptions and mental helath appointments to look forward to, but hopefully things will get better soon.</resource>
  <resource id="217.30">I am still having trouble walking straight and am slurring a lot (so excuse the grammar), but things are getting better.</resource>
  <resource id="217.31">My mother was there for me the whole time while I was scared to death, losing consciousnes, and fearing for my life, and I will always remember that.</resource>
  <resource id="217.32">The goal was to go to sleep and never wake up, but after taking 32 of those dreadful cold pills that put scars on my kidney in the first place, death was becomming all too real too fast.</resource>
  <resource id="217.33">Had loads of tests, including a catheter due to my not being able to urinate.</resource>

  <resource id="219.45">Today was just kind of stressful.</resource>
  <resource id="219.46">My night last night turned out amazing towards 8:00-9:00</resource>
  <resource id="219.47">I had a really nice conversation with Juckett, another amazing one with Phil, and then another one with Solomon.</resource>
  <resource id="219.48">It was definitely a good night of conversation, although I did stay up until 12:30, and I payed for that this morning in 1st period (Physics)</resource>
  <resource id="219.49">But all of a sudden today it's hit me that I have all this work due.</resource>
  <resource id="219.50">But it's not, "Oh this is due tomorrow.", but more like, "Okay, this is due next friday."</resource>
  <resource id="219.51">I have so much long-term work that I'm not sure if I'll get it all finished with band practice every night, a football game friday, and a competition all day Saturday.</resource>
  <resource id="219.52">So I'm a little stressed out.</resource>
  <resource id="219.53">But, tonight I'm attempting to get a good portion of it finished.</resource>
  <resource id="219.54">I'm starting my argument on illegal immigration (which I may say is turning out fantastic with the first two praragraphs I have), and I finished one of my US History charts, and I plan on outlining a bit once I start watching America's Next Top Model.</resource>
  <resource id="219.55">Plus, all this stuff is being forced on me with my Dad.</resource>
  <resource id="219.56">The courts and my lawyer and my therapist and my mom are all getting mad because I don't have all this time in the world to hang out with my Dad for a few hours.</resource>

  <resource id="223.119">Okay y'alls.</resource>
  <resource id="223.120">So I'm sitting here with chapped lips.</resource>
  <resource id="223.121">I went to the dentist today was some fillings and instead I got a root canal.</resource>
  <resource id="223.122">I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to need root canals at 16, so I feel a little guilty.</resource>
  <resource id="223.123">soo.</resource>
  <resource id="223.124">it wasn't too bad.</resource>
  <resource id="223.125">First they gave me a swab to numb my gums, then two shots.</resource>
  <resource id="223.126">The first shot didn't feel like anything, the second shot hurt, but it was more of a dull ache, not like the blood draw I had this morning.</resource>
  <resource id="223.127">I can handle dull aches, it's the sharp pains that freak me out.</resource>
  <resource id="223.128">Then they fucked around with my teeth, which never hurt (except for the clamp), but I was on edge, because it felt like it was about to hurt, like any moment they might hit a nerve.</resource>
  <resource id="223.129">Annnndddd.</resource>
  <resource id="223.130">so the nurse was doing suction, and she accidently hit the rubber sheath across my mouth (isolating the tooth) which made a very loud noise in my ear, so I flinched, and the dentist was like "It's not big deal, show her it's nothing to be afraid of" so she did it again and I really freaked out, really flinched and even cried out and then I starting crying.</resource>
  <resource id="223.131">It was kind of embaressing, but the dentist starting making these dumb jokes so then I starting laughing.</resource>
  <resource id="223.132">Anyway it wasn't too bad, except they didn't do any fillings, so I still have a loser mouth.</resource>
  <resource id="223.133">And a temp.</resource>

  <resource id="225.163">Ever since Monday morning (Tuesday morning in Japan), Deguchi had been smiling almost constantly at Brad.</resource>
  <resource id="225.164">Which, to be honest, was making Brad slightly nervous.</resource>
  <resource id="225.165">It would've been easy to write it off on the last successful deal that had gone down Monday morning, but Deguchi had given him that same wide grin that morning when they had left for the deal.</resource>
  <resource id="225.166">Perhaps it had just been pre-deal excitement.</resource>
  <resource id="225.167">Sunday night, the evening he had spoken to Schuldig over the phone, was the one night that Brad had actually slept well.</resource>
  <resource id="225.168">He had wanted to call either Yohji or Schuldig last night, but Deguchi had kept him busy attending a ball, not returning home until three in the morning.</resource>
  <resource id="225.169">Brad had promptly fallen asleep, having been up at dawn to make it across the island for the deal that morning.</resource>
  <resource id="225.170">An almost 24 hour day was not Brad's idea of a good time.</resource>
  <resource id="225.171">At least they hadn't needed to be anywhere until lunch this morning.</resource>
  <resource id="225.172">And Deguchi didn't have another social function planned until tomorrow night.</resource>
  <resource id="225.173">It was merely golf all day tomorrow and then the party that night.</resource>
  <resource id="225.174">And then the flight home.</resource>
  <resource id="225.175">And Brad couldn't wait to get home.</resource>
  <resource id="225.176">But in the meantime, he had free time, as Deguchi was passed out in his room from too much liquor and too little sleep and the desire to be as perky as possible for his golf game tomorrow.</resource>
  <resource id="225.177">It was a pleasant Tuesday evening in Hawai'i, Wednesday at home, Brad reminded himself automatically, and he had the doors to the balcony open wide and was sitting on the lone chair looking out over the ocean.</resource>
  <resource id="225.178">He called Yohji, missing him, wanting to talk to him.</resource>
  <resource id="225.179">He just hoped that Yohji had time to talk.</resource>

  <resource id="226.180">Dear Dinah,</resource>
  <resource id="226.181">Oh, it's so soon now, so quick.</resource>
  <resource id="226.182">This is the last day.</resource>
  <resource id="226.183">I didn't go to Speech this morning because there was nothing else for me to turn in.</resource>
  <resource id="226.184">Instead, I went shopping for sandals to wear to graduation.</resource>
  <resource id="226.185">I didn't find any, but did find a five-dollar bathing suit.</resource>
  <resource id="226.186">It's two-piece, green stretch velvet.</resource>
  <resource id="226.187">Not fashionable, but it fits/was five dollars.</resource>
  <resource id="226.188">In Drawing, we played Ms. Wolf's Fun Game.</resource>
  <resource id="226.189">It actually was quite a bit of fun.</resource>
  <resource id="226.190">Even Aaron played, although he hadn't signed up.</resource>
  <resource id="226.191">Wolf was handing out the supplies and she looked so tragic at Aaron's lack of participation that stone-wise Pacheco offered his place to Aaron if it would cheer Wolf up, which it did.</resource>
  <resource id="226.192">The Fun Game itself involved cardboard boxes with mystery items in them and our job was to decorate the boxes any way we wanted.</resource>
  <resource id="226.193">I ill-advisedly painted mine, a messy night-sky that wasn't nearly dry by the end of the game.</resource>
  <resource id="226.194">When it came time to trade boxes and open them, people kept avoiding mine because it left blue paint all over anyone who touched it.</resource>
  <resource id="226.195">Finally one of the Pretty Boys took it, good-naturedly enough.</resource>
  <resource id="226.196">The presents in the boxes were varied and unusual and very useless.</resource>
  <resource id="226.197">Mez got a waffle-iron.</resource>
  <resource id="226.198">I got 24 shades of 80s-colored eyeshadow.</resource>
  <resource id="226.199">It was very bright.</resource>
  <resource id="226.200">Pacheco asked if he could put some on me and he painted me up like a cat, with green-and-purple whiskers and a smudgy pink heart for the tip of my nose.</resource>
  <resource id="226.201">He asked if I could help make him up like a clown, and then the two of us painted Ryan's face like a hooker.</resource>
  <resource id="226.202">We offered to do Aaron too, but he just laughed and shook his head.</resource>
  <resource id="226.203">He really laughed a lot today.</resource>
  <resource id="226.204">You know the kind of laugh.</resource>
  <resource id="226.205">That breathless, relieved one that people get when the traffic accident is over and no one's dead.</resource>
  <resource id="226.206">Pacheco asked me to sign his yearbook and he signed mine.</resource>
  <resource id="226.207">I made me sorry that I don't actually know him.</resource>
  <resource id="226.208">After Drawing, I was standing at Ryan's locker, leaning back, laughing.</resource>
  <resource id="226.209">The bell for last hour had already rung and we were talking to a bunch of Ryan's popular football-friends.</resource>
  <resource id="226.210">I think I am kind of a novelty to them, small and strange, and they are mostly nice enough.</resource>
  <resource id="226.211">I was laughing up at Josh Bloomfield and Peter, when someone spoke softly behind me, very fast.</resource>
  <resource id="226.212">"SorryexcusemeI'msorryIjustneed-"</resource>
  <resource id="226.213">I turned around, and it tells you something (everything) that I could stand there with half the football team, face covered in glitter eyeshadow, and not give a Goddamn what I looked like, but the minute I was staring up at Mink I wanted to be invisible.</resource>
  <resource id="226.214">He just slipped past me to his locker, hunching his shoulders up.</resource>
  <resource id="226.215">I wanted to wipe the green-and-purple whiskers off with my hands, but was afraid of making it worse, so I didn't do anything.</resource>
  <resource id="226.216">Ryan was kind of standing on the outside of the group, which makes sense, I guess.</resource>
  <resource id="226.217">He's not on the football team.</resource>
  <resource id="226.218">As Mink turned from his locker and slid through the crowd, Ryan watched him go.</resource>
  <resource id="226.219">I said, "He always seems so nervous."</resource>
  <resource id="226.220">Ryan nodded.</resource>
  <resource id="226.221">"Yeah.</resource>
  <resource id="226.222">I know.</resource>
  <resource id="226.223">I feel kind of bad."</resource>
  <resource id="226.224">"What for?"</resource>
  <resource id="226.225">"Well, he was in my ICP class, sophomore year.</resource>
  <resource id="226.226">And - you know Leif Carlson? - me and Leif sat together and that guy shows up late on the first day of class and he was at our same table.</resource>
  <resource id="226.227">He - you know, he had that big coat, and his hair was all shiny and slicked back - and he doesn't smile - so, we just thought." Ryan waved his hands abruptly to show what it was they thought.</resource>
  <resource id="226.228">"Anyway, Leif kind of started it, he said, 'Oh, we'd better watch out, this guy looks pretty dangerous.' And I said something like, 'Yeah, he sure is tough.'"</resource>
  <resource id="226.229">Ryan took a deep breath and looked at me before letting it back out, shaking his head a little.</resource>
  <resource id="226.230">"So, we just did that.</resource>
  <resource id="226.231">To him.</resource>
  <resource id="226.232">For like a week.</resource>
  <resource id="226.233">That's how long it took us to figure out that he was never going to say anything, he was never going to get mad, or tell us to stop, or to fuck off.</resource>
  <resource id="226.234">All we were doing was just kind of.</resource>
  <resource id="226.235">hurting his feelings," Ryan finished flatly.</resource>
  <resource id="226.236">I nodded, felt guilty.</resource>
  <resource id="226.237">Because all those things about Mink are exactly the reason why I can't, well, can't anything, really.</resource>
  <resource id="226.238">And that's total bullshit, because those things shouldn't even matter.</resource>
  <resource id="226.239">I make it into this ridiculous drama, does he like me/does he not like me? when it's not even about that at all.</resource>
  <resource id="226.240">It's about a fucking jacket.</resource>
  <resource id="226.241">When I am really actually honest, I'm just as superficial as anybody else.</resource>
  <resource id="226.242">Only, maybe just in different ways.</resource>
  <resource id="226.243">There are several things I know.</resource>
  <resource id="226.244">I know that he smokes a lot pot, and that's too bad.</resource>
  <resource id="226.245">I know that he fails a lot of things, and that's too bad.</resource>
  <resource id="226.246">But those are weak reasons, compared to other things I know, like he has never been anything other than kind to me, and he has always been polite, and he is not stupid and I've never in three years seen him be cruel to anyone.</resource>
  <resource id="226.247">Mostly though, I know that I am just as bad as everyone else.</resource>
  <resource id="226.248">And also, I look like a cat.</resource>
  <resource id="226.249">Love.</resource>

  <resource id="229.314">Nasty Labels</resource>
  <resource id="229.315">There are plenty of buzzwords and buzzphrases circulating around today that have been programmed into our minds so that we have a negative reaction upon hearing them.</resource>
  <resource id="229.316">Words and phrases like "terrorist, "anti-semitic", "anti-war", "Islamo-fascist", "protest" and "communist".</resource>
  <resource id="229.317">That last one alone has been responsible for more fear-mongering than the presently seated Bush administration has been able to muster in the past six years, and that's a pretty tall order.</resource>
  <resource id="229.318">The "BOO!" machine runs full-time at the White House these days.</resource>
  <resource id="229.319">What's interesting about their motivations is that most of what we're supposed to be afraid of is actually simply informative alternatives to the status quo: the fear of change.</resource>
  <resource id="229.320">The government wants us to be afraid of terrorists so that they can pass more questionable legislation that makes it easier to control us.</resource>
  <resource id="229.321">They want us to not criticize the Zionists who give the Jews a bad name, because of how much Zionists influence U.S. foriegn policy in the name of Israel.</resource>
  <resource id="229.322">They want us to be scared of protesting and dissenting in the name of freedom, because there are more of us than there are of THEM.</resource>
  <resource id="229.323">I even suggest that the government has always wished us to be afraid of communism, because it goes against the very thing that government relies upon to keep it rolling: capitalism.</resource>
  <resource id="229.324">Programming In Action</resource>
  <resource id="229.325">From the "Red Scare" and the Communist witch-hunt of the 50's with Senator Joe McCarthy aggressively pursuing perceived threats to the safety and security of America, to the current fear and loathing of so-called communist countries such as North Korea, Cuba and China, actual communism has never, ever existed.</resource>
  <resource id="229.326">Dictators like Fidel Castro and Kim Jong Il oversee police-states, but aren't purveyors of actual communism as espoused by Marx.</resource>
  <resource id="229.327">Like other socialists, Marx and Engels sought an end to capitalism and the systems which they perceived to be responsible for the exploitation of workers.</resource>
  <resource id="229.328">But whereas earlier socialists often favored longer-term social reform, Marx and Engels believed that popular revolution was all but inevitable, and the only path to socialism.</resource>
  <resource id="229.329">- from Wikipedia</resource>
  <resource id="229.330">Even within so-called modern communism, there are many splits and factions, notably between Marxist/Leninist communists and anarchists.</resource>
  <resource id="229.331">I was led, through an interesting internet surfing session, to a full-on philosophical debate between members of these two camps in which it appears as though the Leninist scored a numbing defeat.</resource>
  <resource id="229.332">While perusing the pages detailing the battle of words, I ran across a detailed look at just what the revolution might look like, if it truly indeed ever happened.</resource>
  <resource id="229.333">For that matter, it looks as if it could be happening right now, no matter what "-ism" you slap it with.</resource>
  <resource id="229.334">Recipe for a revolution?</resource>
  <resource id="229.335">Perhaps.</resource>
  <resource id="229.336">And it makes pretty clear the idea that the continuation of this charade of voting booths and elected officials is never going to turn America around and make it the Utopia that many hope it will become; unless the people get serious about organizing and ceasing this selfish, alienating style of life that we cling to.</resource>
  <resource id="229.337">The very act of revolution demands a will stronger than "Dancing With The Stars", "Cribs" and the latest incarnation of "CSI."</resource>
  <resource id="229.338">It demands sacrifice on a level that most people today are unwilling to muster.</resource>
  <resource id="229.339">We are a nation of air-conditioned, drive-thru frequenting, automatic can-opener using, processed meat-eating, hands-free restroom-using workers.</resource>
  <resource id="229.340">We live to work, but work is not our collective life.</resource>
  <resource id="229.341">Most of us do not choose to work.</resource>
  <resource id="229.342">We work because the system demands that we operate the machinery.</resource>
  <resource id="229.343">Only after we have been put through the schools, which teach us not to think for ourselves or question what we're taught, only after we're encouraged to seek higher learning in order to make the highest dollar, do we then enter a life-long engagement in a vocation that keeps us away from the things we actually wish to do.</resource>
  <resource id="229.344">That's the American Dream.</resource>
  <resource id="229.345">The dream that you can fight hard and work to get ahead, put money away and eventually leave the factory of human flesh, at age 65, to finally live what's left of your shriveled life, aided by the promise of a Social Security plan that our dear leader, the "Decider" is actually trying to privatize, just like our national banking system.</resource>

  <resource id="229.347">I don't have to tell you things are bad.</resource>
  <resource id="229.348">Everybody knows things are bad.</resource>
  <resource id="229.349">It's a depression.</resource>
  <resource id="229.350">Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.</resource>
  <resource id="229.351">The dollar buys a nickel's worth; banks are going bust; shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter; punks are running wild in the street, and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it.</resource>
  <resource id="229.352">We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat.</resource>
  <resource id="229.353">And we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be!</resource>
  <resource id="229.354">We all know things are bad -- worse than bad -- they're crazy.</resource>
  <resource id="229.355">It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out any more.</resource>
  <resource id="229.356">We sit in the house, and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, "Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.</resource>
  <resource id="229.357">Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials, and I won't say anything.</resource>

  <resource id="231.381">Yeah I know I'm 19 but I never worked.</resource>
  <resource id="231.382">I volunteered at a store once but that was about it.</resource>
  <resource id="231.383">I wasn't really nervous.</resource>
  <resource id="231.384">I was more tired because I was used to sleeping in until like 10 but now I have to wake up at 7.</resource>
  <resource id="231.385">The job is really nice.</resource>
  <resource id="231.386">Everybody there is really understanding and it reminds me a lot of the show "The Office", which I love by the way.</resource>
  <resource id="231.387">A couple of girls graduated from Mason, one in particular is my mentor and she's cool.</resource>
  <resource id="231.388">She actually knows a couple of people that I know.</resource>
  <resource id="231.389">The only thing is where I work is a tax law firm place and I don't know any of the terms so I'm learning as I go!</resource>
  <resource id="231.390">Luckily I don't have to do much with numbers cause I deal mostly with the phone, oh and did I mention they don't mind if we're on AIM, check our e-mail, or look up random stuff online as long as we get our work done?</resource>
  <resource id="231.391">It's pretty sweet and I feel very blessed that I have it.</resource>
  <resource id="231.392">I thank God for allowing me to make such a wise decision.</resource>
  <resource id="231.393">Oh and my mentor, she's Catholic and she teaches CCD so me and her get along pretty good.</resource>

  <resource id="233.415">Today, I was pulled out of a meeting by our building manager, who was in a blind panic.</resource>
  <resource id="233.416">The problem turned out to be that I needed to choose a paint color for the walls of the new office space.</resource>
  <resource id="233.417">This was apparently an emergency.</resource>
  <resource id="233.418">(Why yes, I have in fact spent the rest of the day imagining paint-based emergencies.</resource>
  <resource id="233.419">"Nurse, a can of the #47 crocus blue satin finish!</resource>
  <resource id="233.420">At once!")</resource>
  <resource id="233.421">Ahem.</resource>
  <resource id="233.422">Anyway, we tracked down the paint chip sample brochure buried on the receptionist's desk, and I pulled out my carpet samples, preparing to face my daunting choice--which turned out to be between two nearly identical shades of office off-white.</resource>
  <resource id="233.423">I went with the slightly more creamy white, rather than the slightly more grey white.</resource>

<block id="block 234">
  <resource id="234.425">I checked two poltergeist books out of the library today.</resource>
  <resource id="234.426">One is exactly what I was looking for: balanced between skepticism and open-mindedness, unsensational, intelligent and very interesting.</resource>
  <resource id="234.427">The other is appalling crap: disorganized, blatantly pseudoscientific, and misogynistic.</resource>
  <resource id="234.428">The pseudoscience could probably be blamed at least in part on its late-70s vintage - maybe things like multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia were so poorly understood and poorly approached at the time that this gobbledegook was passable (or else maybe these disorders were so poorly understood that they were as hokey to established science as poltergeists).</resource>
  <resource id="234.429">I suppose attitudes towards women have changed a lot too, but this was so awful I threw up my hands and returned the book before leaving the library.</resource>
  <resource id="234.430">Regarding Esther Cox, for instance: he theorizes that she was "sexually frustrated" and that a part of her was furious with herself when she rejected the advances of her would-be rapist, and that this fury manifested itself as the poltergeist tormenting her.</resource>
  <resource id="234.431">He goes on to describe her in later years as unhappily married, fat, and sullen.</resource>
  <resource id="234.432">Hello, hostile much?</resource>
  <resource id="234.433">The result is that all of his comments about the "sexual energy" of any of his (mostly female, mostly pubescent) subjects come out with a kind of leer behind them.</resource>
  <resource id="234.434">Yeah.</resource>
  <resource id="234.435">EWWW.</resource>
  <resource id="234.436">Interesting how these books about mostly female, mostly pubescent subjects - often described as having "nervous" or "mental" disorders - are mostly written by middle-aged men.</resource>
  <resource id="234.437">So freakin Freudian I could scream.</resource>
  <resource id="234.438">There's lots of interesting material in the other book, at least.</resource>

  <resource id="235.442">You know, "Easy?"</resource>
  <resource id="235.443">It wasn't performed by Lionel Ritchie this time, but by Faith No More.</resource>
  <resource id="235.444">It's an alright song, the guy is hot shit, but when it's on that commercial, it annoys me to the point of driving me up the fucking wall.</resource>
  <resource id="235.445">There's currently a commercial on rotation, I advertising what capitalistic piece of crap it is this time, but it is a terrible, terrible, cover of "In a Big Country."</resource>
  <resource id="235.446">By a band called Big Country.</resource>
  <resource id="235.447">I also heard somewhere that the song was covered by Dashboard Confessional.</resource>
  <resource id="235.448">If I were Big Country, I'd want to stab myself in the chest with a goddamn jigsaw right at this moment.</resource>
  <resource id="235.449">I see this commercial every morning; it is an omen for a very bad day.</resource>
  <resource id="235.450">We have all had (or are still having, perhaps for the rest of our lives) our encounters with stupid people, but it's the ones who just won't stop bothering you that are among some of the worst.</resource>

  <resource id="235.453">Anything is cooler than my fascist, totalitarian, dictarorial mother.</resource>
  <resource id="235.454">But then again, even my mom is greater than Sally.</resource>
  <resource id="235.455">I'd like to tell Sally to go eat shit.</resource>

  <resource id="235.463">Very odd and peculiar.</resource>
  <resource id="235.464">An omen?</resource>
  <resource id="235.465">A Christina that just doesn't give a fuck anymore?</resource>
  <resource id="235.466">You choose the answer.</resource>
  <resource id="235.467">But, I made up for the lameness that ensued by stealing an organizer for myself.</resource>
  <resource id="235.468">Good deal.</resource>
  <resource id="235.469">My first day at Banana Republic is actually going to be this Saturday, not Sunday.</resource>
  <resource id="235.470">Some chick named Monica called and asked if I could work.</resource>
  <resource id="235.471">Sure.</resource>
  <resource id="235.472">Who doesn't need money?</resource>
  <resource id="235.473">Oh I know, the kids who are voted "Best Dressed" in school.</resource>
  <resource id="235.474">Ha!</resource>
  <resource id="235.475">Isn't it aggravating when someone is practically demanding you to hang out with them?</resource>
  <resource id="235.476">No, not Sally this time.</resource>
  <resource id="235.477">I told this person that I can't, many times, and for this time I have a pretty good reason - one that if unfollowed, may result in my own fatal decapitation by hands other than my own.</resource>
  <resource id="235.478">In other words, I cannot go to this person's house on Friday to watch horror movies because if I don't stay home and rest and study for the SATs on Saturday, my mom will take matters into her own hands.</resource>
  <resource id="235.479">No pun intended.</resource>
  <resource id="235.480">Get a fucking clue.</resource>
  <resource id="235.481">More importantly, get some friends other than me. I know I'm flexible, but there's times when I simply cannot do certain things because of timing.</resource>
  <resource id="235.482">Suck it up.</resource>
  <resource id="235.483">Go find someone else to be your bitch.</resource>
  <resource id="235.484">Sure, it's nice to see people wanting to be within your presence, but when they step over the line and enter the realm of stupidity, self-esteem issues and denial of self-being, well then I want to do nothing but kick you in the fucking baby maker.</resource>
  <resource id="235.485">Much like this video where Mike Patton throws stupid people off the stage, grabs a fucktard, humps him, shoves the mic down his throat and later starts a fight with the same guy who still proceeds to climb back onto the stage.</resource>

  <resource id="237.504">About recent events---so glad to have A baptized.</resource>
  <resource id="237.505">I struggle with the Catholic concept of baptism being a gift we give infants because it is God's gift to us.</resource>
  <resource id="237.506">As a person who chose to be baptized at age--oh, boy, how old was I?</resource>
  <resource id="237.507">31?--the act of choosing is very special to me. I had to make a conscious choice to pick Jesus as a personal savior, corny as that may sound.</resource>
  <resource id="237.508">And you can bet I gave it a lot of thought.</resource>
  <resource id="237.509">Having the girls baptized is not something I will regret, as I plan to raise them cognizant of and faithful to the faith.</resource>
  <resource id="237.510">They can always choose not to go to church.</resource>
  <resource id="237.511">And maybe having been baptized Catholic, they will come back to the church.</resource>
  <resource id="237.512">Oddly, or perhaps not so oddly, I find that I cannot follow all of the "Church" teachings.</resource>
  <resource id="237.513">In particular the prohibition against birth control is one that chafes me. Some could say that if I had deeper faith in God then I would not be afraid of having lots and lots of children.</resource>
  <resource id="237.514">I an not afraid of having lots of children.</resource>
  <resource id="237.515">I am not afraid of having another child.</resource>
  <resource id="237.516">I just know having another one right now would cause great havoc in the tender new environment that Dave and I have with the girls now.</resource>
  <resource id="237.517">Giving it all over to God to decide is such a lovely idea.</resource>
  <resource id="237.518">God does know what is best.</resource>
  <resource id="237.519">And God provided all sorts of opportunities for us to use knowledge in regard to family planning.</resource>

  <resource id="238.524">The next time I actually get you on the phone when you're not a)tired b)not in the mood or c)just plain not wanting to talk to me please don't elect to watch a movie instead of having a conversation with me. It's these types of choices that make it hard for me to justify trying to be your friend.</resource>
  <resource id="238.525">Me: Yah uh, I was with about 12 other people ready to watch a movie we were supposed to start an hour before for a class, Kinda already planned.</resource>
  <resource id="238.526">I made the TIME to talk to you before the movie started, so, A)when im not the only one involved it's not exactly MY decision to make and B) I neither desired nor "elected" to watch a movie instead of talking to you and C) Your assumptions are pretentious and hurtful.</resource>
  <resource id="238.527">It's those types of choices that make it hard for me to justify a friendship.</resource>
  <resource id="238.528">first let me say, this is one of the stupidest fucking reasons to be (once again) pissy with someone.</resource>
  <resource id="238.529">Fucking seriously kid.</resource>
  <resource id="238.530">This was on myspace today.</resource>
  <resource id="238.531">Im rather sick of myspace.</resource>
  <resource id="238.532">Eric kind of ruined if for me because whatever any male friends say to me he has something to say back, plus he blog's on there.</resource>
  <resource id="238.533">Im not particularly interested in what ANY of his blogs have to say.</resource>
  <resource id="238.534">Ive noticed an abundance are usually about me, and rather stupid.</resource>
  <resource id="238.535">So i've stopped listening.</resource>
  <resource id="238.536">every once in awhile one or two titles will catch my eye and I will read it, but for the most part i really am sick and tired to stupid repetitive shit.</resource>
  <resource id="238.537">Not to mention the same "learning experiences" and "new discoveries" or opinionated ideas towards me that always seem to change week to week, so whatever.</resource>
  <resource id="238.538">i attempted to have a normal conversation with him, and apparently my basic human right to hang up whenever I choose to do so, Is not allowed.</resource>
  <resource id="238.539">Gag, enough on that crap.</resource>
  <resource id="238.540">No more.</resource>
  <resource id="238.541">Anyways, I went to Court yesterday.</resource>
  <resource id="238.542">It was scary driving down I-25 and i pissed someone off upstairs because It rained the whole fucking way down.</resource>
  <resource id="238.543">Not helping my fear of hydroplaning and wrapping my car around a pole.</resource>
  <resource id="238.544">Court was intimidating but I did good.</resource>
  <resource id="238.545">I dressed conservatively and had no idea what I was doing.</resource>
  <resource id="238.546">Long story short, I learned a lot.</resource>
  <resource id="238.547">Traffic court is uh, a lot more serious than I thought.</resource>
  <resource id="238.548">And It got ruled that it was my vehicles fault not mine, and the I got minimum sentence possible for my ticket.</resource>
  <resource id="238.549">The results: Careless Driving (required when you hydroplane) and 2 points on my driving record and 60 dollar fine.</resource>
  <resource id="238.550">I actually got it pretty good.</resource>
  <resource id="238.551">Every one was really nice, even the judge.</resource>
  <resource id="238.552">I was scared because there were other people there and he was not nice to the person before me. But it went well.</resource>
  <resource id="238.553">With the accident fee and other crap it cost me 95 dollars which is better than I thought and two points on my clean driving record really will not matter either.</resource>
  <resource id="238.554">I get 9 in one yr and ive never had a ticket before, so i will be fine.</resource>
  <resource id="238.555">The exciting part of my day, as cliche as it sounds was a car fire.</resource>
  <resource id="238.556">Yah i know, baggage, shit follows me. I exited onto Thornton parkway and there way a Jimmy on the side of the road smoking.</resource>
  <resource id="238.557">No biggy, but it was not angled (no popped tire) and the smoke was dark black, I know that's not normal.</resource>
  <resource id="238.558">So i pulled over and ran up.</resource>
  <resource id="238.559">This kid was in the back seat with the door open and his leg hanging out.</resource>
  <resource id="238.560">I walked up to him "Whats going on, you need some help?"</resource>
  <resource id="238.561">He says "oh im an idiot im trying to get my stuff out" I asked him if he knew the car was smoking.</resource>
  <resource id="238.562">He said yah.</resource>
  <resource id="238.563">I backed up during all this and looked under the vehicle only to see flames roaring towards the gas tank.</resource>
  <resource id="238.564">So i Told him it was on fire I dont think he heard me, So i grabbed his smeater and yanked him out of the car, he stumbled back, dropped his shit and looked at me pissed "what the fuck lady" we got about four or five steps from the vehicle when the gas tanked popped (not a hollywood explosion here people) and burning gas flew out everywhere, catching the grass on fire, blowing out both rear tires and because the door was open, the interior of the vehicle started going up in flames.</resource>
  <resource id="238.565">It was fucking sweet (only because it was not my vehicle and ive been out of the fire service for school and i miss it)SO.</resource>
  <resource id="238.566">after some silence from the driver his attitude changed and hes like "thanks that could have been me" and repeated "oh my god" while I got an ETA on police and fire from dispatch and gave her information.</resource>
  <resource id="238.567">All this before court.</resource>
  <resource id="238.568">The news people showed up, talked to the kid and he pointed at me while I was telling the cop I had to go, because i really did not want to be late, and I left.</resource>
  <resource id="238.569">after though I was thinking about it, it would have been kinda cool to get interviewed for pulling him out.</resource>
  <resource id="238.570">i dont think I saved his life, but i may have saved his legs and a lot of skin.</resource>
  <resource id="238.571">Who knows.</resource>
  <resource id="238.572">Point is it was exciting.</resource>
  <resource id="238.573">I remain "anonymous" in the newspaper and life goes on.</resource>
  <resource id="238.574">Poor kid though.</resource>
  <resource id="238.575">he gave me a hug, that was good.</resource>
  <resource id="238.576">There's something about a hug from a stranger who means it.</resource>
  <resource id="238.577">An honesty.</resource>
  <resource id="238.578">Anyways, Life goes on.</resource>
  <resource id="238.579">And i've been thinking, my earlier comment about how this stuff finds me. Many people drove past, and many cars were infront of me in that exit lane, maybe this stuff is just as equally around everyone, I only choose to stop.</resource>
  <resource id="238.580">I sat unconscious in my car for only a minuet because it people couldnt miss the fact that I flipped and rolled into the open ditch on the highway, I twas daylight people actually pulled over in the oncoming lane and ran over the barrier.</resource>
  <resource id="238.581">but If it was more discrete, and people only saw the car in the ditch, or only saw me take out the sign, how long would it have taken someone to stop?</resource>
  <resource id="238.582">How many people a day drive by cars with hadards on, or sitting n the side of the road.</resource>
  <resource id="238.583">how do you know that person is not having a heart attack or a seizure?</resource>
  <resource id="238.584">How do you know that smoke is not from a tire, and the car could be on fire??</resource>
  <resource id="238.585">People drive by this stuff everyday, I think I look at it differently because of my experiences and the department, so I stop.</resource>
  <resource id="238.586">maybe if people were less involved in their own affairs people who are having bad luck could get a helping hand more often.</resource>
  <resource id="238.587">I know I was grateful to those who pulled me out of my car.</resource>
  <resource id="238.588">I know I was scared hanging in my seatbelt until someone banged on my window and told me it was going to be ok. It only took me 10-15 minuets to help him out, and I bet it made a big difference.</resource>
  <resource id="238.589">He didnt even get my name, but Im sure he will not forget me.</resource>
  <resource id="238.590">K, enough with that kinda thought.</resource>
  <resource id="238.591">I've homework to do.</resource>
  <resource id="238.592">And I want to go to buffalo wild wings with Jen.</resource>
  <resource id="238.593">Oh yeah, I went to my uncles shop after court, the weather started to clear up.</resource>
  <resource id="238.594">I got new brake parts and my bronco stops good now.</resource>
  <resource id="238.595">the speedometer broke on my way down, but it decided to fix itself.</resource>
  <resource id="238.596">Its having an identity crises, not sure if its going to be working, or broken.</resource>
  <resource id="238.597">But uncle beeve saved the day and fixed a bunch of stuff for me. Called it an early Birthday present, he is so amazing.</resource>
  <resource id="238.598">Than i drove to lake wood around familiar routes to try and get my confidence back with driving.</resource>
  <resource id="238.599">Uncle beeve showed me all the brake parts and how it's normal, and not going to fail on me. I do feel better about driving, a lot better than earlier that morning.</resource>
  <resource id="238.600">While I was in lakewood I surprised Brian and we met Scooty for lunch, suprised him too.</resource>
  <resource id="238.601">It was SOOOO nice to see them.</resource>
  <resource id="238.602">Just what I needed to collect myself and continue home.</resource>
  <resource id="238.603">The drive back to Greeley was much better.</resource>
  <resource id="238.604">Novmber 11th is the next time i will for sure be there for the weekend, I have courtney and im coming down early to stay at scotts.</resource>
  <resource id="238.605">He does not know this yet, I need to call him this week.</resource>
  <resource id="238.606">I can't wait to go on a night drive with Brian and just chill out there for awhile.</resource>
  <resource id="238.607">Dar-Babe is hanging out tonight with the guy's, I was supposed to work.</resource>
  <resource id="238.608">But Maria does not want me too, so Paul came in for me. My finger needs to get better faster.</resource>
  <resource id="238.609">It feels pretty good today.</resource>
  <resource id="238.610">So, Im going out with some friends later, do some homework, both our work uniforms are dirty (all of them) so I think I might do laundry, and make our bed.</resource>
  <resource id="238.611">Typical day I suppose.</resource>
  <resource id="238.612">Yesterday was eventful, today is relaxing.</resource>
  <resource id="238.613">Good to love life.</resource>
  <resource id="238.614">Im going to mail grandma a letter tonight.</resource>
  <resource id="238.615">We're ganging up on her to get her out of the house on her own to visit my other grandma in Vegas.</resource>
  <resource id="238.616">They both just lost their husbands and Vegas grandma has had more time, were hoping she will help Canada grandma feel better.</resource>
  <resource id="238.617">Katie is good, still not walking on her own yet, but her biking accident has made her focus more on school.</resource>
  <resource id="238.618">Which I am so happy for.</resource>
  <resource id="238.619">I am so proud of my sister.</resource>
  <resource id="238.620">She will be just fine.</resource>
  <resource id="238.621">im sick of looking at a computer screen.</resource>
  <resource id="238.622">And my spelling is SO bad.</resource>
  <resource id="238.623">I know noone who reads this besides myself, so it does not matter.</resource>
  <resource id="238.624">no goal tonight.</resource>

  <resource id="242.719">In the morning I went to visit CBGB (their last show is next week, boo, got awesomely lost and showed up at The Onion 15 minutes late.</resource>

  <resource id="242.723">I had to listen to each fully and make note of any audio or labelling defects and whether there was an advertisement at the end.</resource>
  <resource id="242.724">I totally loved it, because I am a geek.</resource>
  <resource id="242.725">I walked out of the office and directly into a ginormous trailer.</resource>
  <resource id="242.726">At first I thought that someone had inexplicably decided to RV in the middle of Broadway, but a man with a French accent told me it was for a Will Smith movie.</resource>
  <resource id="242.727">It was pretty crazy, with lots of officious film-type people walking purposefully in random direcctions for about a three block stretch.</resource>

  <resource id="242.732">I didn't see Will Smith (although the French Prince is usually my shit, I think I would have had to punch him on behalf of everyone who's heard "Switch"), but the girl on the elevator with me said she had just randomly seen Mike Myers.</resource>

  <resource id="242.735">Of course, as soon as she came in, John came over and said, "You realize, Molly, that you're not allowed visitors, and we will have to give you thirty more lashes."</resource>

  <resource id="243.747">Hey all,</resource>
  <resource id="243.748">Good news.</resource>
  <resource id="243.749">My approach to Futureshop worked.</resource>
  <resource id="243.750">I got a call this morning asking me to come in for an interview today at 1:30pm.</resource>
  <resource id="243.751">I was psyched.</resource>
  <resource id="243.752">I got all dressed up and ran out the door for it.</resource>
  <resource id="243.753">Halfway to the bus station, I realized that I forgot my resume.</resource>
  <resource id="243.754">ugh.</resource>
  <resource id="243.755">I went back, had 6 mins to go get it and get back to the bus stop.</resource>
  <resource id="243.756">I got it, got back to the station and my bus came right away.</resource>
  <resource id="243.757">I got on the bus, dropped my resume on the wet floor and almost dropped my mp3 player.</resource>
  <resource id="243.758">I was a wreck due to the nervousness, lol.</resource>
  <resource id="243.759">Normally I would be fine, nervous but fine.</resource>
  <resource id="243.760">It's just that I forgot the resume and rushed and was all shaken up due to that.</resource>
  <resource id="243.761">So I tried to relax on the bus on the way.</resource>
  <resource id="243.762">When I got there, I went in and told them I was there and waited.</resource>
  <resource id="243.763">I was called in and 2 guys interviewed me. I was completely honest throughout the interview from telling them about the handcuff story with Danika to the dirty joke story when I was working at the movie theatre.</resource>
  <resource id="243.764">At one point I apologized for being so nervous and they told me that there were people a lot worse and that I wasn't using the words "uh" and "um" as often as others had been.</resource>
  <resource id="243.765">That helped me calm my nerves a bit.</resource>
  <resource id="243.766">The interview was a success.</resource>
  <resource id="243.767">They told me that they would set me up for the next interview by calling me in the next day or 2.</resource>
  <resource id="243.768">The next interview is with the general manager of the store, it will likely take place on Saturday.</resource>
  <resource id="243.769">Everything looks good.</resource>
  <resource id="243.770">The 2 interviewing me were thinking of placing me in digital imaging due to my background with photography and video editing, I told them that it would likely turn out to be too easy for me in the long run and that I was hoping for a position more challenging so that I could learn more overall.</resource>
  <resource id="243.771">I said that I want to work in the TV department as I want to learn more about them.</resource>
  <resource id="243.772">Where they will decide to place me is up to them, as long as I get the job, I'll be really happy.</resource>
  <resource id="243.773">Oh, if I get a job at Futureshop, It looks like I would be starting there around November 8th.</resource>
  <resource id="243.774">We'll see how things go.</resource>
  <resource id="243.775">My plans coming up.</resource>
  <resource id="243.776">Tomorrow: Gotta go to MDG for the last time to pick up my paycheck for that week and a half I was there.</resource>
  <resource id="243.777">Friday: Going to a movie or 2 with Paul at Rainbow cinemas</resource>
  <resource id="243.778">Saturday: Hopefully the interview at futureshop</resource>

  <resource id="244.786">suspicious about Mae.</resource>
  <resource id="244.787">That one chick I dislike with a passion because I think she is obsessed with Gareth and really likes him.</resource>
  <resource id="244.788">I dont like her doing that with gareth.</resource>
  <resource id="244.789">Seriously.</resource>
  <resource id="244.790">I really do hate it.</resource>
  <resource id="244.791">And Wow.</resource>
  <resource id="244.792">Okay.</resource>
  <resource id="244.793">So that night I decide.</resource>
  <resource id="244.794">Hmm I remember Gareth's password why don't I spy to see whats going on.</resource>
  <resource id="244.795">So the next morning, I ended up doing that, but while I did that i felt really really really REALLY!</resource>
  <resource id="244.796">bad.</resource>
  <resource id="244.797">I never would do that, but I had to because I was speculating about the whole thing.</resource>
  <resource id="244.798">So I did and I got so panicy that I only got to the 6th page.</resource>
  <resource id="244.799">and I was freak it.</resource>
  <resource id="244.800">I left it, but through out the whole day I was really awful.</resource>
  <resource id="244.801">I couldnt stand what I had done.</resource>
  <resource id="244.802">So.</resource>
  <resource id="244.803">when I got home I was really nervous I hadn't talk to Gareth for 2 days because of college.</resource>
  <resource id="244.804">and he IM me.  he was all happy that he got to talk to me.  but I was scared.</resource>
  <resource id="244.805">Really scared.</resource>
  <resource id="244.806">So he kinda knew something was wrong.</resource>
  <resource id="244.807">So I tell him it took me FOREVER To tell him but i was shakey and nervous to.</resource>
  <resource id="244.808">So I did anyway.</resource>
  <resource id="244.809">in a WORD document.</resource>
  <resource id="244.810">and he said that it was understandable.</resource>
  <resource id="244.811">that mae has been annoying him.</resource>
  <resource id="244.812">Then he said that he's not worried about her taking him away from me.</resource>
  <resource id="244.813">I felt like a total jerk.</resource>
  <resource id="244.814">He had guessed it too!That i went on his myspace.</resource>
  <resource id="244.815">And he said I gave you my password for a reason, so we wouldn't have to keep secrets from each other.</resource>
  <resource id="244.816">Well.</resource>
  <resource id="244.817">yeah I felt stupid.</resource>
  <resource id="244.818">Majorly.</resource>
  <resource id="244.819">Then.</resource>
  <resource id="244.820">He's like, Would it make me happy that I delete her off my friends list and messenger.</resource>
  <resource id="244.821">And I was like.</resource>
  <resource id="244.822">Well if you want.</resource>
  <resource id="244.823">I mean I really did want to.</resource>
  <resource id="244.824">because I dislike her very much.</resource>
  <resource id="244.825">But at the same time, I don't want him deleting his friends if he's still cool with her talking and shit.</resource>
  <resource id="244.826">But I was like, Do what you want.</resource>
  <resource id="244.827">He's like yeah he would wait a couple of weeks and delete her.</resource>
  <resource id="244.828">I didn't think I had the power to tell him that.</resource>
  <resource id="244.829">but it happened.</resource>
  <resource id="244.830">I still feel ashamed about it</resource>
  <resource id="244.831">Very much.</resource>
  <resource id="244.832">And I hate these mistakes I do.</resource>

  <resource id="246.844">so i hear people talking about how life's a bi*ch, and the then u die, wel, i agreed with that for a good minute until i found out that it isn't necessarily that simple.</resource>
  <resource id="246.845">it's not about life being only a bit** and then we die, it's more about how life's a bi*ch and then we fall off a cliff and live!!</resource>
  <resource id="246.846">that means we can actually feel the pain, if only life was a bi*ch and then we die, it would actually be a good thing, shoot, death is painless, or so the say, so that'll be good, unfortunately it's not as simple.</resource>
  <resource id="246.847">it's a little more complicated.</resource>
  <resource id="246.848">right now the happiness i was so proud of in my earlier blog has taken a 360 degree turn, and i'm as miserable as someone being tortured in saw3, someone has put  a knife so far down my spine, it hurts more than a car ruunning me over 3 times.</resource>
  <resource id="246.849">life is crazy, ain't it??</resource>
  <resource id="246.850">i'm so down right now i can't be anymore upset.</resource>

  <resource id="246.852">by ur mother?</resource>
  <resource id="246.853">lol, it's kinda  funny when i write it, but while it happened i was scared for my life.</resource>
  <resource id="246.854">now she can't trust me, it's really crazy, now noone trusts me as before, so the sweet ady everyone knew now is the lying ady noone understands.</resource>
  <resource id="246.855">all i can say in my defense is that whatever they're thinking isn't true.</resource>
  <resource id="246.856">my man and i know it's true.</resource>
  <resource id="246.857">so, i ain't much to prove.</resource>
  <resource id="246.858">i want to give a special thanx to my man cuz he's my rock right now, he's the mountain blocking my dark light and i appreciate it 100% he probably doesn't know it, but he's the only one that believes me, and understands.</resource>
  <resource id="246.859">thanx babe.</resource>
  <resource id="246.860">anyways, back to the real cruel world, i'm pist so i'mma go to sleep.</resource>
